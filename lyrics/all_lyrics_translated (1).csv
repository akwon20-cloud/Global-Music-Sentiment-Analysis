Memories how I played us feelings on the strings
You are not destroying, because you are not my
If I see someone touch you

To be able to rip it off the fucking
I will not give olives for a few months
Because I welded it badly
I am heading from the apartment, but I do not know where
From an apartment where you managed to replace locks

In your eyes

I see the whole universe
Falls sak and not snow

Playing the Bakht (and then?), I asked her and rejected me
I was surprised, Omal Vin my prestige?
My love, I laugh at my disappointment
My brother, I was steadfast and shook me
And what is missed was a magician
It is not on her mind
I am in my mind, not my property
I said words before you do not see me
Do you know me difficult and not understandable
My words are not weighted
Or you love a limit
They did not see it, and no one blames me
An innocent angel, nor I am deceived
Come on, tension, and I am shaken
Or hurt it, and everyone is rejected

Not the story?My love, I don’t know me

And I am difficult for me, and I have sweet words
Far from my eyes and my eyes, with someone else and I am not happy
This is my life, my life, and I love you, love, not conditional

I do not meet promises as an animal
And I grew up on nothing guaranteed
My words may be with me
In love, I do not see a return
Related to my broken heart
What his problem is that you are scattered
Who chose what your eyes did
This is not my fault, I woke up

Never talk about rewards

Solo
You have to doubt that I am ridiculous in the world (I am absurd)
The season is rapidly changing in summer solstice
Enter the parallel universe
How can I accept tomorrow and have been separated

If the sky lost your light at the beginning
Will life be alone?
Children's years are crazy to avoid the madness of the world
That little fortress builds this utopian
If you are discouraged that day, you don't see you beside you
Who is willing to listen to my willful vent of the worst time for me to be frustrated
Always borrow my familiar shoulders
Emotions can be chaotic

When you are lonely, your optimistic face is still behind
Tears also dry up, but you are naturally an oasis to give me energy like old
Lightly the most bright star fight in the island

46,Netherlands,Davina Michelle,Duurt Te Lang,"In a letter, a text message, I wrote in a song
""I will do everything for you and I live for your love""
And I got that love, and often in for over
You could leave the thresholds of life to me
You saw those girls hate because I had my superhero
You had just told your friends about me too often
Now we are staring together at the table with the mouths closed
Looks that speak of our face automatically
I have done the vast majority of everything
But I drive too long in this tunnel and I don't see light
So close your eyes for our last set
And think back to the small house with the small bed
Shit, but tomorrow the pain will be back
We spend hours at the stop, the train runs back

It takes too long
We've been here for a while
And we have to go through
So for the last time, I'm sorry
It takes too long, Woah
It takes too long
We stand still what you want, what I want
It takes too long

Two silent people at the table, it's not a face
I can't walk that route with my eyes closed
You know exactly what I'm going to say, I know about you too
And at the end I will tell you how much I love you
And then the doors beat again and another glass breaks
Then another tear falls and I grab my bag again
And then I will hold you firmly again
And put my clothes back in the cupboard
(So) I will hold you for a while
(Because) you will forget how angry you were
But the pain stays on, so it doesn't help
So probably it will be the same song again tomorrow
The text comes down to the same beat
A kind of golden paint on a block of sorrow
Conflicts are normal, but it should not suffocate us
My tears do not fall, so I let the song sob

It takes too long
We've been here for a while
And we have to go through
So for the last time, I'm sorry
It takes too long, Woah

This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
Woah-oh
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey115Embed"
73,Uruguay,Manuel Turizo,La Bachata,"You hurt me, and so I miss you
And although I know that one day I'm going to forget you
I still don't do it, it's complicated
To 'what I did' I like to remember

I'm driving on the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not asked
I better ask God to take care of me
Because I'm driving on the streets you kissed me
Hearing the songs you dedicated to me one day
I would tell you to come back, but that is not asked
I better ask God to take care of me, huh

That takes care of another that looks like you
I don't want to fall as I did for you
I hope you fell in love, I do the same thing you did to me
You taught me not to love anyone
And also how do I not want them to love me
No-oh-oh, we were three in a two-way relationship
I don't forgive you, ask God for forgiveness
I said that I forgot you and the truth e 'that I-Oh-Oh
I-oh-oh
