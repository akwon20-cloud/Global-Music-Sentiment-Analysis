Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
You might also like
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch276Embed","[['approval', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'optimism'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['caring', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['disappointment'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['realization', 'surprise'], ['excitement', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['realization'], ['confusion', 'neutral'], ['disappointment', 'sadness', 'neutral'], ['disappointment'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['realization', 'surprise'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['caring', 'joy'], ['neutral'], ['disapproval'], ['excitement', 'neutral'], ['excitement', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['disapproval', 'neutral']]"

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168Embed","[['fear'], ['confusion', 'disappointment', 'surprise'], ['desire', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['approval', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['disappointment', 'disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'realization'], ['fear'], ['love'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['approval', 'neutral'], ['love'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['disappointment', 'disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'realization'], ['confusion', 'neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['caring', 'love', 'neutral'], ['caring'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['disappointment', 'disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'realization'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['disappointment', 'disapproval'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'realization'], ['neutral'], ['love', 'neutral']]"

I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights

I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground

But you never go away (Never go away)

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?

Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company
I know that I must do what's right
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

If I'da let my walls come down?

20,20,Dean Lewis - Be Alright,"153 ContributorsBe Alright Lyrics
I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

Feelin' my way through the darkness
Guided by a beatin' heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost



I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Alright, okay
Uh, alright, okay

Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

Sleutels vast, de deurknop heb ik in m'n hand
Maar ik twijfel of ik nog wel echt naar binnen kan
Jouw iedere beweging lijkt bij mij vandaan
'k Heb je hart zo lang niet open meer zien staan

Wil je weten hoe het danst zonder mij?
Misschien heb je meer balans zonder mij
Als het moet zet ik een stapje opzij
Als het beter, als dat beter is

Heeft het leven dan meer glans zonder mij?
Krijgt de liefde weer een kans zonder mij?
Als dat echt zo is dan laat ik je vrij
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Wil niet zeggen dat ik jou niet mis

De voordeur die gaat open en ik sla weer dicht
Al staat wat ik wil zeggen wel op mijn gezicht, oh
Ik kan niet met je praten dus ik hou me stil
Maar het voelt of je voor mij niet vechten wil

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality

I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

She loves it when I call her señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya

Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah

She loves it when I call her señorita
I wish I could pretеnd I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should bе runnin'
Ooh, I know you love it when I call you señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'

Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself

You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now

And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts

Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it inside

I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)

Every time you're close, I get out of breath
Wondering, wondering, wondering what'll happen next
Oh, is it my imagination? It's got my heart beat racing
Fallin' in, fallin' in, fallin' in, feel it in my chеst

I've got a fever, so can you chеck?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? (I've got a fever)

Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now, now, now, now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down (I've got a)
Tell me what you wanna do right now

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music

This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows

I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell, yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say (Yeah)
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm

Down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air

We're down the river, we're drunk, and all of our thumbs went up in the air
Sung it in the wind, and sung to the thunder, rollin' over and over
We're down

We're getting on fire
We're raisin' up higher
The bottle is up, we're over the top, it's time to get wild

75,75,Oasis - Wonderwall - Remastered,"1 ContributorShotty Horroh vs. Shuffle T Lyrics
When I say ""long life"" you say, ""Pat Stay""
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Some said I wasn't gonna-
(Show up, that's what the talk was about
But I show up to the showdown
To show off when the show's on for all of the crowd!)
Shuffle T
Haha...fuckin' he
""I like to talk about multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
Stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause you got this humongous-
Shuffle T
Haha...fuckin' he
""Oh I wrote the book on multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
You stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?
Ancient tribes?
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe
No, conspiracy theories
Children of The Matrix vibe
David Icke
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype
He looked me dead in the face, and right
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""
""Complicated rhymes?!""
""Yeah. Multisyllabics
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it
Why would I go to a club and get plastered
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""
I'm joking
He's kissed a girl before
Have you kissed a girl before?
He's kissed a girl before
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced
The man even pointed a score
Give her just under a four
She laughed it off
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more
Fuckin' run for the door
Fuckin' guy
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times
Got you lookin' like you come disguised
As a cunt that likes the under 5's
Nonce!
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat
He hasn't washed it in years
He takes it off and it stands on it's own
That coat is alive
It's symbiosis
It demands the controls when attached to a host
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned
""Oooh yeah.""
""Oooh ye-""
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like Dexter's Lab
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched
I had to get a 
Fuck that coat!
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?
Baow!
That's my first round in, safe star blessed
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!

Everybody’s been, telling me I won’t ever survive my next foe
I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row
They’ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone
I’m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let’s go!
That’s why I’ve drafted a will…
Now I'd like Sounds Like to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro
And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat
And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price’s bedpost
And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for Death Note
Because I’m battling Shotty Horroh – yeah?
The genius
I mean it
In Manchester, this guy is Jesus
I am in utter shock, I'm giddy – in pieces
Underprepared best man...I’m speechless
They said, ""Shotty’s back to battling, it’s just like the olden days.""
Couldn’t believe it “God’s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades”
Well fuck it I’m back, too
What’s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle
Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl
But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly
He called it off… I’m like, ""What? But mate, you promised me.""
I asked if it’s still happening, he’s like “Maybe. Possibly”
I’ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy
Too pussy to actually face me properly
He’s pissing himself worried that he’ll take a loss to me (colostomy)
It’s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy
Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude?
Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?!
And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate
It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday
We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know
Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own
I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go
This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show
I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: 'Roids
Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised
Think about it all he has is a loud voice
But your writing’s more of a shits how than Mrs. Brown’s Boys
You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes
You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis
I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest
You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis
Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin
But now he’s addicted to working out and it’s poisoned him
You on social media is an extremely annoying thing
My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym
I want the stick person that we’ve seen, this version baffles me
Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we’ll see a big surge in casualties
Such a fake guy he’ll only fake fight, he’ll inverse to atrophy
Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality
I’m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed
I’m talking to him, since it’s clear a therapist never did
Cause you on social media is nuts
I mean, you’ve got this anger that brews
There’s different versions of him, these doppelgängers you use
Someone says something you don’t like? He’s gotten mad in a mood
Now, Shotty’s back in the room, you’re not the Adam we knew
This constant angst is problematic, what’s the matter? Drop the act
This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth
That’s not what adults should do
Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view
Like you’re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve
Not everybody’s a snake, a shocking fact, but it’s true
When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you
You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer
Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user
Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future
I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa
So don’t let his bullshit blur your vision
Don’t be intimidated by a word he’s written
Cause what he writes isn’t true like tabloid journalism
So don’t be scared, most Horroh’s (horror) stories are a work of fiction
He's alright, isn't he?
Probably someone with a case for the top 4
Not many can joke as good as him
You normally know I'm goin' to win
But today...you aren't sure
That's fine
Bastards
He's a formidable opponent
You're just livin' in the moment
That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors
Until Brizzy said, ""Look Shuffle over"", well then I made space for one more
The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene
For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh
Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed
I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed
Funny how you're called ""Shuffle"" when we always know what's comin' next
I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme & Rap Beginner classes
Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes
With a knife that's stashed within my jacket
Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed
Drive it back
The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction
You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta
They kinda clash as mirror matches
Cause you're both full of gas
And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with
Try me, try me, try me
Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion
They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard
Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances
I heard, ""Shuffle's outside""
Let's get this Muppet outlined
I don't give a fuck about rhymes
I got this gun from 'round mines
Me and my cousin, downsized
It's just us and a brown ride 
Foot in his house like, ""Give it up or your pal dies.""
And Marlo stood there like, like, ""I don't mean to trouble you now guys
But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00
I'm just worried about time
Gun butt him
Outlines
Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime
Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries
""Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!""
{gun cocks}
What does it sound like?
And Marlo stood there...joke
Fuck that! I'm outrageous
If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist
I'm the sensei
What's a sensation to an out station
Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations
There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers
If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient
Ahh
Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas
I am thee, without a doubt greatest
Out of town blazin', an ounce 
You're just me, without flavor
Downgraded, outdated
Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish
Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him
Fuck Shuffle T!
I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements
DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers
You rhyme words together really well
That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle
That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle
That's where you seem to struggle
You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle
YOU let him do this with no conviction
Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble
He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle
That's why we don't believe in ya
So many elite MC's that leagues above ya
We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle
You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part
I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card
You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code
Like it's an invincible spell
He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L
All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be
If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well
I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself
Second round in, safe star bless
Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left

{Shuffle pulls out his phone}
""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?
Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards
2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card
My place of work is Shotty Horroh’s Graveyard
My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start
I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar
And I think he’s in denial cause, I know where the graves are
And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast
If we ask too many questions he forces us out
He turns up some days and orders us 'round
He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now
Some are saying he won’t show up
That’s what people are saying
It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess
I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express
And if I ask how they died that’s a sackable offence
Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?
I’m calling today cause I’ve just had someone through, Tali
Another hopeless victim
And I’m looking around and I’ve got no idea for the life of me where I’m s’posed to fit him
Plot 3?
No that’s taken. It’s taken it don’t need filling
Well, I can put Tali in there but he’s going to have Tony with him
I get that these things are best handled with stealth
It’s just - it’s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health
But I guess I’ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt
What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.""
Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying
When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him
That, and you've put on a  amount of weight
A bit of padding around the face
You're the man of the house, it's great
I bet your calorie count's insane
But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised
I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape
Now, he DID beat me in that film VS – but it was hard for me to lose that
Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that
It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?”
I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.”
In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts
To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his
At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit
The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.”
I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck
Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff”
I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut
Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough”
Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey
Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry
But it’s an understatement if you're describing me as ‘hungry’
That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’
I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round
I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown
You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh
We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half
Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you
The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62
I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room
And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to
Your mom gives it to me
So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space
Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates
I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay
I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today
Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage
I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age
Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million
I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant!
So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle
Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’
Time

I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck
I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them
As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them
But there's this Joe Pesci notion...
Funny how? If you focusin'
Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em
Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'
But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him
Cause I don't fuck my friends over
You get bad luck from it
Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic
Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever
He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure
He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better
Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together
He does not give a fuck
I've never met anybody as bold as he is
Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'?
And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings
He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating
Boys I have Ronan Keating.""
He does not give a fuck, you have to understand
That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys
Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists
I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down
I'm just sayin', you ain't legit
Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this
Loyal to the soil
I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz
You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit
That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this
Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it
And I'm the guy that pays you it
And I did your little panel show for free twice
It was COVID times I let the love persuade me
You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy
You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I 
Cause me charging Shuffle shady
Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me""
So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class
These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps
And wanna turn it into data and a 
""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop""
FUCK OFF!
We ain't got the patience for all a dat
For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed
I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book
I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps
People hated, FUCK THAT
I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank
Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match
Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut
Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious
It's not a joke
Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks
It's one of those
Why do your arms look so heavy bro?
I gotta know
You look like every single  trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home
Fuckin' strange guy
Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time
And thank you very much
Another straight, white, male with a podcast
With long hair and edgy jokes
It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand
That's me, thank you

Now your music has actually been a little different lately
When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady
That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy
I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!""
I said, “Yeah, Definitely Maybe
Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'
Then you just 'Roll With It'
Head up in the clouds
I mean he doesn’t hear it
It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about
No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound
In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
'Don't Look Back In Anger'
You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock
Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not
You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully
But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be
Cause when you sell out your art for a dime
It’ll never be far from your mind
Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb
You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights
Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines
And everything’s harder to rhyme
Integrity’s hard to define
But when you pretend to be part of a life
Of the celebrity’s art that you like
All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime
So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise
That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes
Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit
The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist
You’re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6
That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like
""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick
The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it
I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it
Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit
""Italian blood running the streets"" – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering
I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring
See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym
I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him
Let me say something simple and make it official
Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle
Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme
You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme
People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak
Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?
Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?”
I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.”
So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is
I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit
Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music
I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin' stupid
This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent
You make something simple feel like rocket science
I make rocket science feel like comic timing
Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python
It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it
Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted
I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness
This counterfeited coward’s limits
There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it
Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit
They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image
Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus
You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed
I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy
So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!
Take that belt to its biting point
I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s!
If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap
Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed
Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq
Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!
See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it
You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips
You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it
I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh, woah, mm, oh
And you let her go, oh, woah, uh, no
Well, you let her go

'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit

She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection

I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it

You better watch how ya talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away

I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?

Maar mijn hoofd zei nee-ee-ee
Een eindeloze tweestrijd binnenin
Want mijn hart zei o-o-oh

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park, but meantime
South of the river, you stop, and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie, double-four time
You feel alright when you hear the music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowing that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Yes and an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man, he steps right up to the microphone
And says at last, just as the time bell rings
“Goodnight, now it's time to go home”
Then he makes it fast with one more thing
“We are the Sultans—
We are the Sultans of Swing”

Gisteren zat ik hier met een vriend
We hadden het over toen ik jou verliet
Al best lang geleden, toch te lang gewacht
We hadden het over je ziel en je kracht
Hoe jij dat zo zag dan, hoe jij je gedroeg
Nee voor jou was er nooit iemand genoeg
Jij was 't speciaalst, deed nog nooit iets verkeerd
Met gesloten ogen bеkeek ik het weer

Hoe ik toen een mеisje was, jij een vreselijke droom
Had mezelf het gezegd en mezelf het beloofd
Dat het afgesloten, weg met verdriet
En ik zou het vergeten, maar het lukt me weer niet
Want de pijn die blijft, het zit dieper dan dat
Ik zou een moord doen zodat ik je woorden vergat
Want dat klotegevoel dat toen is ontstaan
Dat gaat nooit meer weg en dat heb jij gedaan

Gisteren kwam er een besef
Jij duwde iedereen ver van me weg
En dingen die jij tegen me zei
Dat vrienden me haatten, maar jij hield van mij
Je uitspraken waren zo goed als gestoord
Vooral met een slok op dan draaide je door
Nu makkelijk praten, had weg moeten gaan
Maar graag had ik nog zoveel anders gedaan

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!
