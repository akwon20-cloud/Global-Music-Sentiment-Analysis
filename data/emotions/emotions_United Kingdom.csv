Comin' out of my cage, and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes

1,1,Lewis Capaldi - Someone You Loved,"222 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaEspañolPortuguêsDeutschNederlandsFrançaisTürkçeالعربيةSomeone You Loved Lyrics
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
You might also like
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
You might also like
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
But I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made

You've had a few? (Had a few)

I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?
Ancient tribes?
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe
No, conspiracy theories
Children of The Matrix vibe
David Icke
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype
He looked me dead in the face, and right
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""
""Complicated rhymes?!""
""Yeah. Multisyllabics
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it
Why would I go to a club and get plastered
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""
I'm joking
He's kissed a girl before
Have you kissed a girl before?
He's kissed a girl before
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced
The man even pointed a score
Give her just under a four
She laughed it off
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more
Fuckin' run for the door
Fuckin' guy
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times
Got you lookin' like you come disguised
As a cunt that likes the under 5's
Nonce!
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat
He hasn't washed it in years
He takes it off and it stands on it's own
That coat is alive
It's symbiosis
It demands the controls when attached to a host
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned
""Oooh yeah.""
""Oooh ye-""
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like Dexter's Lab
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched
I had to get a 
Fuck that coat!
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?
Baow!
That's my first round in, safe star blessed
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!

Everybody’s been, telling me I won’t ever survive my next foe
I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row
They’ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone
I’m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let’s go!
That’s why I’ve drafted a will…
Now I'd like Sounds Like to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro
And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat
And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price’s bedpost
And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for Death Note
Because I’m battling Shotty Horroh – yeah?
The genius
I mean it
In Manchester, this guy is Jesus
I am in utter shock, I'm giddy – in pieces
Underprepared best man...I’m speechless
They said, ""Shotty’s back to battling, it’s just like the olden days.""
Couldn’t believe it “God’s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades”
Well fuck it I’m back, too
What’s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle
Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl
But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly
He called it off… I’m like, ""What? But mate, you promised me.""
I asked if it’s still happening, he’s like “Maybe. Possibly”
I’ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy
Too pussy to actually face me properly
He’s pissing himself worried that he’ll take a loss to me (colostomy)
It’s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy
Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude?
Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?!
And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate
It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday
We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know
Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own
I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go
This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show
I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: 'Roids
Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised
Think about it all he has is a loud voice
But your writing’s more of a shits how than Mrs. Brown’s Boys
You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes
You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis
I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest
You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis
Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin
But now he’s addicted to working out and it’s poisoned him
You on social media is an extremely annoying thing
My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym
I want the stick person that we’ve seen, this version baffles me
Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we’ll see a big surge in casualties
Such a fake guy he’ll only fake fight, he’ll inverse to atrophy
Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality
I’m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed
I’m talking to him, since it’s clear a therapist never did
Cause you on social media is nuts
I mean, you’ve got this anger that brews
There’s different versions of him, these doppelgängers you use
Someone says something you don’t like? He’s gotten mad in a mood
Now, Shotty’s back in the room, you’re not the Adam we knew
This constant angst is problematic, what’s the matter? Drop the act
This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth
That’s not what adults should do
Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view
Like you’re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve
Not everybody’s a snake, a shocking fact, but it’s true
When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you
You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer
Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user
Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future
I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa
So don’t let his bullshit blur your vision
Don’t be intimidated by a word he’s written
Cause what he writes isn’t true like tabloid journalism
So don’t be scared, most Horroh’s (horror) stories are a work of fiction
He's alright, isn't he?
Probably someone with a case for the top 4
Not many can joke as good as him
You normally know I'm goin' to win
But today...you aren't sure
That's fine
Bastards
He's a formidable opponent
You're just livin' in the moment
That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors
Until Brizzy said, ""Look Shuffle over"", well then I made space for one more
The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene
For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh
Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed
I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed
Funny how you're called ""Shuffle"" when we always know what's comin' next
I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme & Rap Beginner classes
Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes
With a knife that's stashed within my jacket
Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed
Drive it back
The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction
You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta
They kinda clash as mirror matches
Cause you're both full of gas
And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with
Try me, try me, try me
Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion
They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard
Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances
I heard, ""Shuffle's outside""
Let's get this Muppet outlined
I don't give a fuck about rhymes
I got this gun from 'round mines
Me and my cousin, downsized
It's just us and a brown ride 
Foot in his house like, ""Give it up or your pal dies.""
And Marlo stood there like, like, ""I don't mean to trouble you now guys
But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00
I'm just worried about time
Gun butt him
Outlines
Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime
Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries
""Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!""
{gun cocks}
What does it sound like?
And Marlo stood there...joke
Fuck that! I'm outrageous
If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist
I'm the sensei
What's a sensation to an out station
Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations
There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers
If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient
Ahh
Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas
I am thee, without a doubt greatest
Out of town blazin', an ounce 
You're just me, without flavor
Downgraded, outdated
Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish
Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him
Fuck Shuffle T!
I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements
DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers
You rhyme words together really well
That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle
That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle
That's where you seem to struggle
You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle
YOU let him do this with no conviction
Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble
He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle
That's why we don't believe in ya
So many elite MC's that leagues above ya
We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle
You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part
I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card
You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code
Like it's an invincible spell
He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L
All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be
If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well
I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself
Second round in, safe star bless
Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left

{Shuffle pulls out his phone}
""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?
Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards
2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card
My place of work is Shotty Horroh’s Graveyard
My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start
I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar
And I think he’s in denial cause, I know where the graves are
And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast
If we ask too many questions he forces us out
He turns up some days and orders us 'round
He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now
Some are saying he won’t show up
That’s what people are saying
It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess
I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express
And if I ask how they died that’s a sackable offence
Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?
I’m calling today cause I’ve just had someone through, Tali
Another hopeless victim
And I’m looking around and I’ve got no idea for the life of me where I’m s’posed to fit him
Plot 3?
No that’s taken. It’s taken it don’t need filling
Well, I can put Tali in there but he’s going to have Tony with him
I get that these things are best handled with stealth
It’s just - it’s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health
But I guess I’ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt
What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.""
Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying
When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him
That, and you've put on a  amount of weight
A bit of padding around the face
You're the man of the house, it's great
I bet your calorie count's insane
But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised
I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape
Now, he DID beat me in that film VS – but it was hard for me to lose that
Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that
It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?”
I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.”
In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts
To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his
At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit
The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.”
I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck
Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff”
I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut
Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough”
Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey
Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry
But it’s an understatement if you're describing me as ‘hungry’
That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’
I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round
I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown
You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh
We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half
Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you
The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62
I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room
And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to
Your mom gives it to me
So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space
Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates
I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay
I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today
Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage
I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age
Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million
I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant!
So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle
Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’
Time

I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck
I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them
As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them
But there's this Joe Pesci notion...
Funny how? If you focusin'
Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em
Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'
But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him
Cause I don't fuck my friends over
You get bad luck from it
Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic
Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever
He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure
He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better
Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together
He does not give a fuck
I've never met anybody as bold as he is
Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'?
And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings
He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating
Boys I have Ronan Keating.""
He does not give a fuck, you have to understand
That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys
Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists
I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down
I'm just sayin', you ain't legit
Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this
Loyal to the soil
I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz
You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit
That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this
Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it
And I'm the guy that pays you it
And I did your little panel show for free twice
It was COVID times I let the love persuade me
You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy
You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I 
Cause me charging Shuffle shady
Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me""
So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class
These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps
And wanna turn it into data and a 
""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop""
FUCK OFF!
We ain't got the patience for all a dat
For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed
I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book
I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps
People hated, FUCK THAT
I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank
Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match
Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut
Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious
It's not a joke
Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks
It's one of those
Why do your arms look so heavy bro?
I gotta know
You look like every single  trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home
Fuckin' strange guy
Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time
And thank you very much
Another straight, white, male with a podcast
With long hair and edgy jokes
It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand
That's me, thank you

Now your music has actually been a little different lately
When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady
That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy
I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!""
I said, “Yeah, Definitely Maybe
Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'
Then you just 'Roll With It'
Head up in the clouds
I mean he doesn’t hear it
It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about
No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound
In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
'Don't Look Back In Anger'
You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock
Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not
You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully
But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be
Cause when you sell out your art for a dime
It’ll never be far from your mind
Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb
You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights
Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines
And everything’s harder to rhyme
Integrity’s hard to define
But when you pretend to be part of a life
Of the celebrity’s art that you like
All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime
So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise
That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes
Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit
The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist
You’re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6
That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like
""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick
The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it
I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it
Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit
""Italian blood running the streets"" – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering
I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring
See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym
I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him
Let me say something simple and make it official
Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle
Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme
You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme
People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak
Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?
Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?”
I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.”
So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is
I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit
Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music
I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin' stupid
This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent
You make something simple feel like rocket science
I make rocket science feel like comic timing
Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python
It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it
Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted
I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness
This counterfeited coward’s limits
There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it
Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit
They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image
Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus
You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed
I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy
So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!
Take that belt to its biting point
I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s!
If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap
Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed
Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq
Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!
See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it
You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips
You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it
I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know

But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

But the very next day, you gave it away (You gave it away)
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (Special)

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it

But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart

I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere

There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun

Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
You might also like
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless

31,31,Oasis - Don't Look Back in Anger - Remastered,"7 ContributorsInvisible Mass of the Back Row LyricsI stand in the middle of the room, surrounded by anxious faces. It is my turn to recite the day's lesson. The Inspector's ruler points to me.
""Stand up. Recite the adventures of Columbus. What was the date of Columbus' landing in Jamaica? What were the names of his ships? Why was he in the Caribbean?""
My heart pounds. The heat of the morning sun, soaking through the galvanised roof, is magnified inside the schoolroom. The stench of fear is in everyone's nostrils. Something tells me that my days of being hidden, disposed of, dispatched to the invisibility of the back row, are numbered.
I stand up, my limbs shaking uncontrollably, sweat dripping from my armpits, my eyes inflamed. My belly aches. I am petrified. Words fail to come out. They are formed in my head, but my lips do not speak them. The Inspector's eyes pierce me through. They demand a response, demand to be respected and obeyed.
""What was Columbus doing here anyway?"" The trapped words inside my head tumble out. The rebel inside me is alive. The schoolroom becomes even quieter, if that is possible.
""You in for it,"" Patricia, sitting next to where I stand shaking, mutters without moving her lips. I know she is speaking the truth.
The Inspector's face is frozen. Miss Henderson, form six teacher, pounces with the ruler. Her face says she is sure she could not have heard what she thought she heard.
""What did you say, Hortense?""
From I don't know where, a power surges through me. My fists clench. My teeth lock into each other. Miss Henderson reads challenge in my face. I stand still, not daring to say any more.
""What did you say?"" she commands, challenging me to repeat my facetiness. And again it happens. Words gush out of my mouth. ""Is what Columbus did want? Who invite him here?""
Before the last word has left my lips, the sharp sting of the ruler cracks my knuckles. Stupidly, I had left my clenched fist on the desk in front of me. The blow brings me back to the steam bath. Sweat now drips from my face, floods my armpits, drips from between my legs.
I could kill this woman with her sharp pointed nose, mean eyes and frightened face. We cross eyes, and for an instant I see the fear which has trapped us in this rank, smelly room. Miss Henderson is afraid. She is as much afraid of the Inspector as I am.
My brains, what brains I have left, are bouncing around in my skull, goading me on. I will get more of the ruler. It is written across Miss Henderson's wrinkled forehead. My life is at an end! At least in this school. If Miss Henderson does not kill me with this ruler, my aunt is sure to finish me off when she  hears how I back-chat the Inspector and Teacher Henderson.
My parents are in England and living with my aunt is like walking a tight-rope. One little slip and I am in big trouble. Dis look and smell like big trouble to me.
The lunch bell echoes throughout the school. My salvation? For now, anyway.
Hungry bellies rumble in the steam bath, but we are still transfixed by the Inspector, paralysed by Miss Henderson's stare. Feet shuffle, fingers scratch prickly skin. From outside there is the freedom of released bodies bouncing against the partition and liberated voices rising. They magnify our imprisonment. But the walls have been breached. The jailers are quick to realise that this battle is lost. For now.
""Class dismissed,"" the Inspector grudgingly commands. Miss Henderson lowers her eyes.
""Good afternoon, Inspector. Good afternoon, Miss Henderson,"" we recite. Miss Henderson steps aside, stiffly. Fifty tense bodies scurry past, politely, straining to taste the fresh, if hot air of the noonday world and feed themselves from the lunch women under the cotton tree. But first there is Lorna Phillips to take care of. Somebody has to pay for this.
""Yo red pickney always sit a de front of de class. Unno t'ink is because yu pretty. Is only ‘cause teacher frighten fi yu pupa,"" I curse Lorna, as we bundle down the steps, out of earshot of Miss Henderson and the Inspector.
""Is 'cause yu black and stupid why teacher meek yu sit a de back all de time,"" Lorna chirps in.
""Is who you calling stupid? Yo want yu bloody nose right here?""
This is always the outcome of a tense morning in school. A fight often follows the Inspector's visits.
Lorna pushes past me and tries to make a break for the school gate. But I give chase, followed by Samuel, Tim, Patricia, Maud and Yvonne. Today she will pay for being teacher's favourite, for being ""red"", for being rich, for having everything I don't have.
""Look how fast she moving on dem marga foot,"" taunts Yvonne.
""Come, let we beat her up,"" I shout, and we surge forward, pursuing Lorna out of school.
I might not know the answers, but I can fight.
Just then, from behind the school gate, Teacher Edwards comes into view. He is big, sturdy and beautifully dark, with a baby moustache. He is handsomely dressed in his Dashiki suit. There is a kindness about this man that is not usually found among teachers. He would always listen to you, and not just take the teacher's side. He only beat you if he really feel you was out of order, rude, or you get catch with something you thief. We respected and even liked him.
The running stops, slows to a polite walk. The hot pursuit melts into fixed grins and prim steps.
""Good afternoon, children.""
""Good afternoon, Teacher Edwards,"" we still the vengeance in our voices long enough to chant in unison.
Lorna makes the most of Teacher Edwards' presence.
Walking as fast as she could, she says her polite good afternoon and makes a beeline for the hill which distances her from the rest of us. She is safe this time. We turn down the hill.
""Meek she gone. We'll get her tomorrow,"" we plot. My voice and limbs quiet down. For the first time that day, my heartbeat falls back into its normal silent rhythm. There is always tomorrow.
It is the pain of the Inspector that has fuelled my blood; the pain of the ruler was nothing. Chu, mi use to beatings. One little ruler slap a nothing. But dat renking, facety man. A way him come from? Dis warra warra man, jus' a bother people head. Him 'now de score. After all him is suppose to be black.
My uncle say all a dem collude to humiliate, not just me, but all a we, all de people who look like me. All de poor black people dem. Meek him no pick pan de red pickney dem, a meek him t'ink say is we alone no know nothing.
I walk silently down the hill with the others. Each of us is distracted by our own thoughts and anger at the morning. Food hunger is temporarily forgotten. Lorna Phillips and de Inspector dem all de same. Have plenty of money and hate we.
At the bottom of the hill, we are nourished by a wealth of warm, familiar sights and smells. The lunch women come into view. They are always there, big and strong, jutting out from the base of the towering cotton tree. Miss Ivy, as always, has on her red tie-head. In the afternoon sun, as she sits on her three-legged stool, it makes her face glow. Her food box is secured between her legs.
Aunt Dine always smells of cinnamon. You know her smell, because if you dare to make her laugh and expose her bare toothless black gums, in quiet moments she will give you a big smothering hug. Her missing teeth give her face a funny, quaint look. She is never scary to us because she lives in our district and we know her.
Miss Mavis always sits to the right of Aunt Dine, because, she says, she is practising to be on the right hand side of her Maker. Miss Mavis has the most beautifully oiled, ivory coloured skin in the whole world, and white, white eyes which twinkle and wink at you when she talks. She is never cross for long, but will cuss you out one minute and tell you scriptures the next. Her face is electric, whirling and changing as she speaks. Her eyes search your face for understanding.
And then there is one-foot Herby who is always late with his sky-juice and snowball. He can argue, always on about ""de dam hot sun,"" which is ""good for nothing, and only melting him ice, quick, quick, o'clock.""
The boxes are unwrapped. Our senses are assaulted by saltfish fritters, fried dumplings, red herring, cornmeal pudding, sweet potato pudding, oranges, plums, mangoes or sugar-cane, snowball and skyjuice. Smells mingle and whirl, creating a comfortable oasis under the gigantic cotton tree. That same tree serves as a lover's nest and gambling spot at nights. If trees could talk, what stories this one would tell!
We go down the hill. The gloom of humiliation, the pain of the assault on all of us, lifts. We search for our lunch money and think of food. Like swarming bees we descend, shouting our orders to the lunch women.
""Unny stop de noise and wait. How many han' yu t'ink we have?"" Miss Mavis quietly reprimands.
The shouts subside only for a moment as we change our orders and surge again.
''Two penny worth of dumpling and saltfish, please Miss Mavis.""
""Mi only want one fritters.""
""Mi jus' want a piece of cornmeal pudding today.""
""But Aunt Dine dat red herring so little bit.""
""Yu have no crackers again Miss Ivy?""
""How come Herby teck so long fi share de ice?""
The clutter and bustle carry on until the sweat is running down the women's faces. Wash-rags, carried on shoulders like a uniform, mop brows, as they try to keep track of orders and change.
""Lord unny pickney is somet'ing else. Unny gone like nobody no feed unny. Dem mus' a wok unny hard a school today.""
The chatter waves and heaves. The banter and retort goes backwards and forwards until the lunch money secured in pockets and knotted in handkerchiefs has been spent for the day.
Boxes are empty. We mingle, swap and taste each other's purchases, eat, talk with mouths full. As we drift away, so do Aunt Mavis, Aunt Dine and Miss Ivy. Herby is the last to pack up and vacate the cotton tree. The forces have been spent for the day.
Will I one day move from the back row? Would I be let off from reciting the day's lesson, because I know it, just once? Would it ever be my turn to sit at the front, and not have to answer the Inspector’s questions?
The house is buzzing. A letter and a big, big parcel have arrived from England. ""Me mother sending for we. Me and me two brothers going to England."" I sang, ""Me a go a Englan'. Me mumma and puppa send fi we."" Oat will show Lorna Phillips. She have no people in a Englan'. Columbus can get lost. No more standing up in the middle of the class. No more hot, sweaty classroom. No more Teacher Henderson. No more Inspector. Me a go a EngIan'.
November sixteenth. It is dark outside. Night creatures are going to sleep. Day animals still don't know it is time to wake up. Inside, the lamp is lit, casting its honey glow on our faces still dazed with sleep.
""Unno go wash, and put on unno clothes,"" Salna orders. Sleepily, we obey.
The sun is creeping over Easington hills, reflecting the honey glow inside. Its full power is still waiting to wake up. I cannot drink any tea, cannot eat what is to be my last piece of hard-dough bread and butter. My stomach is tight. My jaws are refusing to chew on this familiar taste.
""If yu don't want de tea, lef' it an go put on yu clothes. Dem all dey pon de chair, and don't mess up de hair,"" I am ordered again. I do as I am told. No time for backchatting.
Now there is much coming and going. In the dim light of morning, not yet fully awake, neighbours come to say farewell. They bring parting gifts of mangoes, and presents for relatives in England, not seen or heard from in many years.
Like a stranger, I greet my new clothes, gingerly feeling, inhaling the new cloth smells. I try to work out which piece to put on first without disturbing my newly crafted hairstyle.
I dress in silence, only now beginning to fully realize. Today, my every action, in this dim morning light, is to be registered in the cosmos as my last in this familiar, tiny, two-roomed house.
We pile into the van just as the morning sun claims its place in the sky. It releases its passions and bums away the last stillness of the night. The silence of parting quiets the most active tongue. The drive to the airport is long and hot. Still, the pain of parting traps us in our silent world.
Who will look after Cousy's grave? Who will make sure that the weeds do not choke her roses?
Cousy had not moved, as she always did, when the sun peeped over the hill top. Had not roused me to do my morning chores when night kiss morning awake. I thought Cousy's coldness was just the passing of night. So I slept on, not noticing that her ""old bones"", as she often referred to herself, had not stirred, that her limbs were stiff, that she got colder as the morning got warmer.
Lloyd banging on the door, ordering me to get up and feed de chickens, alerted the yard. I woke to find Cousy's gentle face tight and still, a trickle of tears running from her opened eyes.
""Why are you crying Cousy?"" I asked as I crept sleepily out of bed. There was no reply. And I found myself crying too. Her stillness, her unfocused stare, signalled a change.
I opened the door to find the whole yard gathered outside, waiting. They understood the signals. Death had crept under the door and taken Cousy away in her sleep.
""I want Cousy,"" I hollered, as I fell into Miss Olive's arms.
Does this mean I won't ever again share Cousy's bed and snuggle into her warm bosom? Won't smell her old mysterious smells, and watch her crinkled face?
Now, this thought forces out the hot salty tears which well up inside. I am leaving her behind. The tears flow freely, soiling my newly polished face. Bringing me back to the speeding van taking me away from Heartease, from Cousy, from my goats, from Lorna Phillips. Towards ... the gigantic, shimmering aeroplanes.
The sun releases all its enormous strength. The sea retaliates. It shimmers its bluest blue, a blue that envelops the airport and the parked aeroplanes.
The following hours are filled with a numbness. The only parallels I can think of are visits to the dentist with anaesthetic injected to deaden the pain or when you freshly buck your toe on a big rock stone. My inside is dead. I am cold in the blazing sunshine.
Now, everybody is crying, some pretending that they aren't. Handkerchiefs flap goodbye and wipe streaming eyes. My brothers and I are ceremoniously handed over to a pretty, chocolate-coloured woman dressed in a blue uniform. We follow her, reluctantly, into places of strangeness, places with strange lights and strange demands. People smile knowingly and gather up our belongings.
Then we are sitting in the belly of the gigantic metal bird, which we have only seen before from the ground, looking upwards. This is it. We are going to England.
England brings my mother and father back to me. It drags them forward from the fragile recesses of my young memory. I remember snippets of incidents which had told me of their existence. How long have we been separated? Well, it is hard to know. It was hard, those days long ago, to understand what was going on. I cannot count how many days I was without my father's company, nor am I positive of the many years without my mother's embrace. But memory surges suggest seven years, perhaps, without father and five without mother.
I was not to know then, that although I would return many times, that first departure was the beginning of my exile from Heartease.
Paraffin heaters

""Yes, Salna,"" I replied for the tenth time, to my mother's call from the kitchen. A pokey, steamy place at the back of a cold, cold house.
All the houses I see are stuck together, with no place to play outside, no yard. Do children not play outside in this England? Is it always so cold? Does it ever get warm? Does the sun shine here?
""Now, listen to me child,"" my mother's dark, youthful face smiles down at me, brings me back to the steamy place. I sit huddled in strange clothes, close to the paraffin heater. ""You had better decide what you are going to call me. You can choose from Mother, Mummy, Mum. The same goes for your father. You've got Dad, Daddy or Father to choose from.""
This little talk put an end to days of nervous tension about deciding what to call my England parents. Having arrived, what do you call these newly acquired people? I dreaded answering to my mother’s call. What do you answer when strangers call to you, but they are not strangers really, they are your mother and father? I fell back on old responses, familiar language.
No one told me I would need a new language in dis England.
""My mother who dey a England; my mother who a send fa me in a England."" Here I was without a language to reply to her calls. Lorna Phillips, I still hate you, but oh I wish you were here. At least I know your name.
Mum came with me for my interview at Devon Spencer School. She sat right next to me as I read for the Headmistress. I read but did not know the words of this new language, could not read the words of this strange book. I did my best. I read until I was told to stop, being corrected by the Headmistress. The Headmistress was impressed. I was impressed. My Mum was impressed. My impressive reading enrolled me in one five, the hottest, baddest stream in the first year, only second to one six, the remedial stream.
My strategic location in one five has a familiar feel about it. There is no Lorna Phillips. In this group we have all recently arrived, from one island or another but mostly from Jamaica and all poor, clearly black and one rung from the back row, the bottom stream. This is home away from home. I simply settle down to school life and cultivate the culture of the back row. We graduate in hair plaiting, make up and cussing. Our section of the common-room is dominated by the smell of hair pomander, face powder and Woolworth's latest perfume fragrances.
""You know say Columbus enslave de Indian dem fine in the islands. De same one dem who save him life, and help him restock him ships and tell him say him no reach India yet."" Joycelin is feeding us information as she leafs through her latest book, discovered at the local library.
”You lie!"" The challenge comes from Fay Green. ""Because is Africans dem enslave and ship to de islands, to slave on sugar plantations, fi make sugar fi white people tea in a England.""
The hair on the back of my neck stands up. The room is suddenly very hot. This man, Columbus keeps coming back to haunt me.
""With all de tea dem drink in dis place, is we still a fi meek sugar fi dem fi sweeten it,"" says Joycelin as she continues to leaf through the book, stopping every so often to throw out morsels about the exploits of slavers, life on plantations and the fights slaves and the indigenous Indians waged for their freedom. Conversations weave and heave. We move back and forth between anger, total disbelief and downright outrage.
""Is who write dat book you reading? 'Cause is foolishness you telling me. I don't believe a word of it,” Fay Green finally bursts out.
Each new piece of information is challenged and questioned. We discover heroes, rebels, guerrilla fighters. They help us assert our right to be. Toussaint L'Ouverture, Sojourner Truth, Nanny, Cudjoe, Paul Bogle. The books tell us they all come from our own back yard. Thoughts of them mingle with the hair oils, face powder, and self-affirmation lessons which claim space in our section of the common-room.
Group humiliation replaces individual humiliation here in England schools. This bottom from remedial class gets the meanest, most feared teachers in the school. Their sole intention seem to be to ensure that we know and keep our place. And Columbus keeps coming up. Today's lesson is to make sure we have learnt the lesson of conquest.
Things mingle and whirl in my mind. Easington heat. Easington sweat. English cold. English ice. Frozen faces, frozen information, frozen places.
""Why did Columbus sail to the Indies in 1493, Hortense?"" The frozen face cracks momentarily. “And while you are thinking of the answer, Fay Green you can be thinking of the commodities which Hawkins traded with the Portuguese of the Gold Coast of Africa.""
Indignantly, the back row comes into its own. ""Columbus was looking for a new route to India, so that when he landed in the Caribbean he was good and lost; he thought he was in India. The people who befriended him were massacred and the rest enslaved to mine gold and cultivate sugar. When they died from diseases Europeans brought to the islands, they were replaced by Africans stolen from the Gold Coast of Africa, Miss.""
I said all of this slowly, so that I would say it well. Some of it came out just as I had read it in a book that one of the others had taken from the local library. Slowly, but quickly, because my head was hot and heavy. I can feel the others in the back row feeling proud. We watch the frozen face thaw out. We watch her eyes travel right along the two rows at the back. We watch a stream of red blood rush from the neck to the top of her head.
Fay Green cannot hold her voice back. ""Hawkins traded trinkets for black African people, who were enslaved and shipped to the Caribbean to slave on sugar plantations, to make sugar for English people's tea, Miss.""
All eyes are on the teacher. The back row is tense, wanting an explosion.
The school pips signal the end of the lesson and class five, unusually dignified, stands up and leaves the room. Miss remains fixed to her chair.
Whoops and slaps are heard down the corridor. The back row claims a victory. ""She won't be asking us those stupid questions again, will she?""
Voices are raised, claiming, proclaiming, learning the new language in dis here England.1Embed","[['curiosity'], ['fear'], ['fear'], ['curiosity', 'realization'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['annoyance', 'neutral'], ['curiosity'], ['anger', 'annoyance'], ['fear'], ['neutral'], ['annoyance', 'disappointment'], [], ['realization'], ['annoyance', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['amusement', 'anger', 'annoyance'], ['amusement'], ['anger'], ['approval', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['approval', 'confusion', 'neutral'], ['admiration'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['admiration', 'neutral'], ['caring', 'neutral'], ['optimism', 'neutral'], ['sadness'], ['annoyance'], ['neutral'], ['admiration', 'neutral'], ['admiration'], ['admiration', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['curiosity'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['curiosity'], ['neutral'], ['realization'], ['approval', 'neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['annoyance', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['realization'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['curiosity', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['sadness'], ['neutral'], ['desire', 'neutral'], ['curiosity', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['realization'], ['realization', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['fear'], ['excitement'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['approval', 'neutral'], ['confusion', 'curiosity'], ['neutral'], ['curiosity', 'nervousness', 'realization'], ['disapproval'], ['anger', 'neutral'], ['admiration'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['anger', 'neutral'], ['annoyance', 'fear'], ['anger'], ['anger', 'annoyance', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['realization'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['sadness', 'neutral'], ['pride', 'neutral'], ['neutral'], ['neutral'], ['admiration'], ['neutral'], ['neutral']]"

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

It was Christmas Eve, babe, in the drunk tank
An old man said to me, ""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song, 'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away and dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas, I love you, baby
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome, you were pretty, queen of New York City
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging, all the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night

And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day

Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle

With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'
What did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Counting days, counting days

And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder

And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in White neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go

You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart

Text appears which reads, “...And these children/that you spit on/as they try to change their worlds/are immune to your consultations./They’re quite aware/of what they’re going through.../DAVID BOWIE.”
CUT TO: EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL, DAY
The text on screen shatters and reveals an establishing shot of Shermer High School. Brian’s voice begins to narrate.
BRIAN: Saturday, March 24th, 1984. Shermer High School. Shermer, Illinois, 60062.
Cut to various shots from inside the high school as Brian continues to narrate.
BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon. We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong, but we think you’re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, princess, and a criminal. Correct? That’s the way we saw each other at seven o’clock this morning. We were brainwashed.
Outside the school, Claire sits in a car with her father.
CLAIRE: I can’t believe you can’t get me out of this. It’s so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday. It’s not like I’m a defective or anything.
Claire’s dad sighs and turns to her.
CLAIRE’S DAD: I’ll make it up to you.
He hands her a bag from the back seat..
CLAIRE’S DAD: Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn’t make you a defective. Have a good day.
She gets out of the car. Cut to Brian in a car with his mother and younger sister.
BRIAN’S MOM: Is this the first or the last time we do this?
BRIAN: Last.
BRIAN’S MOM: Well, get in there and use the time to your advantage.
BRIAN: Mom, we’re not supposed to study. We just have to sit there and do nothing.
BRIAN’S MOM: Well, mister, you figure out a way to study.
BRIAN’S SISTER: Yeah.
BRIAN’S MOM: Well, go!
He gets out of the car. Cut to Andrew in a car with his dad.
ANDREW’S DAD: Hey, I screwed around. Guys screw around. There’s nothing wrong with that, except you got caught, sport.
ANDREW: Yeah, mom already reamed me, all right?
ANDREW’S DAD: You want to miss a match? You want to blow your ride?
Andrew shakes his head.
ANDREW’S DAD: Now, no school is going to give a scholarship to a discipline case.
Andrew gets out of the car. Andrew’s dad drives away. John walks up and almost gets hit by Allison’s car, but just keeps walking. Allison gets out. She walks to the passenger side, but the car pulls away.
CUT TO: INT. DETENTION ROOM
Claire is seated in the front row. Brian sits in the row behind her. Andrew enters. He gestures to a seat near Claire. She smiles and shrugs, and he sits down. John enters and steals something from a desk. He walks to Brian and gestures for him to move. Brian gets out of his seat and moves to a different one. John pulls out two chairs and lays across them. Allison enters and sits in the far back. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Vernon enters.
VERNON: Well, well. Here we are. I want to congratulate you for being on time.
Claire raises her hand.
CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir? I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but, um... I don't think I belong in here.
Vernon ignores her and checks his watch. As he speaks we see the reactions of the students
VERNON: It is now 7:06. You have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes to think about why you're here. To ponder the error of your ways. And you may not talk. You will not move from these seats. And you-
He takes one of the chairs John is laying across and moves it.
VERNON: -will not sleep. All right, people, we're gonna try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are.
He hands out paper to the students.
JOHN: Is this a test?
VERNON: And when I say ""essay,"" I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear, Mr. Bender?
JOHN: Crystal.
VERNON: Good. Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. Maybe you'll even decide whether or not you care to return.
Brian raises his hand and stands up.
BRIAN: Uh, you know, I can answer that right now, sir. You know, that'd be ""no."" ""No"" for me, 'cause-
VERNON: Sit down, Johnson.
BRIAN: Thank you, sir.
Brian sits down.
VERNON: My office is right across that hall. Any monkey business is ill-advised. Any questions?
JOHN: Yeah, I got a question. Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?
VERNON: I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull, young man. You'll get the horns.
Vernon walks to his office.
JOHN: That man is a brownie hound.
Allison begins loudly biting her nails. The other students look at her. She notices, but doesn’t stop.
JOHN: You keep eating your hand, you're not gonna be hungry for lunch.
She spits a nail at him.
JOHN: I've seen you before, you know.
BRIAN: Who do I think I am? Who are you?
Brian sticks his pen in his mouth and plays with it.
BRIAN: I’m a walrus.
John gives him a look. Brian takes the pen out. John takes off his scarf. They both go to take their jackets off at the same time and stare at each other. Brian relents and leaves his on. John stares intently at Brian.
BRIAN: It’s the shits, huh?
John turns away, then crumples up paper and throws it to the front of the room. He begins humming.
CLAIRE: I can’t believe this is really happening to me.
JOHN: Oh, shit! What are we supposed to do if we have to take a piss?
CLAIRE: Please.
JOHN: If you gotta go, you gotta go.
He unzips his pants.
CLAIRE: Oh, my god.
ANDREW: Hey, you’re not urinating in here, man.
JOHN: Don’t talk, don’t talk. It makes it crawl back up.
ANDREW: You whip it out and you’re dead before the first drop hits the floor.
JOHN: God. You’re pretty sexy when you get angry.
He turns to Brian.
JOHN: Hey, homeboy. Why don’t you go close that door, we’ll get the prom queen impregnated?
ANDREW: Hey. Hey!
JOHN: What?
ANDREW: If I lose my temper you’re totaled, man.
JOHN: Totally?
ANDREW: Totally.
CLAIRE: Why don’t you just shut up? Nobody here is interested.
JOHN: Really.
ANDREW: Buttface.
JOHN: Well hey, sporto, what’d you do to get in here? Forget to wash your jock?
BRIAN: Excuse me, fellas, I think we should just write out papers.
ANDREW: Look, just because you live in here doesn’t give you the right to be a pain in the ass, so knock it off.
JOHN: It’s a free country.
CLAIRE: He’s just doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him.
JOHN: Sweets.
Claire turns to him.
JOHN: You couldn’t ignore me if you tried. So… So, are you guys like, boyfriend-girlfriend? Steady dates? Lovers? Come on, sporto. Level with me. Do you slip her the hot beef injection?
CLAIRE: Go to hell!
ANDREW: Enough!
VERNON: Hey, what’s going on in there?
Vernon sits in his office, reading a newspaper.
VERNON: Spoiled little pricks.
He doesn’t get up. Cut back to the detention room.
ANDREW: Scumbag.
John gets up and sits on a railing.
JOHN: What do you say we close that door? We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds.
BRIAN: You know, the door's supposed to stay open.
JOHN: So what?
ANDREW: So why don't you just shut up? There's four other people in here, you know.
JOHN: God, you can count. See, I knew you had to be smart to be a, a wrestler.
ANDREW: Who the hell are you to judge anybody, anyway?
CLAIRE: Really.
ANDREW: You know, Bender, you don't even count. I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference. You may as well not even exist at this school.
JOHN: Well, I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team. Maybe the prep club, too. Student council.
ANDREW: Nah. They wouldn't take you.
JOHN: I'm hurt.
CLAIRE: You know why guys like you knock everything?
JOHN: Oh, this should be stunning.
CLAIRE: It's 'cause you're afraid.
JOHN: Oh, God. You richies are so smart; that's exactly why I'm not heavy in activities.
CLAIRE: You're a big coward.
BRIAN: I'm in the math club.
CLAIRE: See, you're afraid that they won't take you. You don't belong, so you just have to dump all over it.
JOHN: Well, it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes, now would it?
CLAIRE: Well you wouldn't know; you don't even know any of us.
JOHN: Well, I don't know any lepers, either, but I'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs.
ANDREW: Uh, let's watch the mouth, huh?
BRIAN: Um, uh, this is a Club, too.
JOHN: Excuse me a sec. What are you babbling about?
BRIAN: Well, what I’d said was, I'm in the Math Club, uh, the Latin Club, and the Physics Club. Physics Club.
JOHN: Hey, Cherry. Do you belong to the Physics Club?
CLAIRE: That's an academic club.
JOHN: So?
CLAIRE: So, academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs.
JOHN: Ah, but to dorks like him, they are. What do you guys do in your club?
BRIAN: In physics, well, we, we, uh, we talk about physics. Uh, properties of physics.
JOHN: So it's sort of social. Demented and sad, but social, right?
BRIAN: Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation. I mean, there are other children in my club, and at the end of the year, we have, we have, you know, a big banquet at the Hilton.
JOHN: You load up, you party.
BRIAN: Well, no, well, we get dressed up. I mean, but we don’t get high.
CLAIRE: Only burners like you get high.
BRIAN: And I didn’t have any shoes, so I had to borrow my dad’s. It was kind of weird because my mom doesn’t like me to wear other people’s shoes. And my cousin Ken- my cousin Kendall, from Indiana, he got high once-
Allison mimes shooting Brian behind his back.
BRIAN: -and he started eating really weird foods, and um, and then he just felt like he didn’t belong anywhere, you know, kind of, like, you know, Twilight Zone, kind of.
CLAIRE: Sounds like you.
ANDREW: Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here. I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads.
JOHN: Oh and wouldn't that be a bite, huh? Missing a whole wrestling meet!
ANDREW: Well, you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot! You never competed in your whole life!
JOHN: Oh, I know. I feel all empty inside because of it. I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys.
ANDREW: Ah, you'd never miss it. You don't have any goals.
JOHN: Oh, but I do!
ANDREW: Yeah?
JOHN: I wanna be just like you. I figure all I need's a lobotomy and some tights!
BRIAN: You wear tights?
ANDREW: No, I don't wear tights. I wear the required uniform.
BRIAN: Tights.
ANDREW: Shut up!
Allison smirks and scribbles. Vernon makes a noise in his office and the kids peer around the corner to see him up and walking around. John makes a show of sitting between Claire and Andrew. Vernon ends up going down the hallway away from the detention room. John gets up and heads for the door.
BRIAN: You know, there’s not supposed to be any, uh, monkey business.
JOHN: Young man, have you finished your paper?
John fiddles with latches on the door.
ANDREW: Come on, Bender, don’t screw around.
CLAIRE: What are you gonna do?
ANDREW: Drop dead, I hope.
Cut to Vernon elsewhere in the building. He inspects a reflection of himself and says something incoherent. Cut back to the detention room.
BRIAN: Bender, that’s school property there. I mean, that’s, you know, it doesn’t belong to us and it’s something that’s not to be toyed with.
John closes the door.
ANDREW: That’s very funny. Come on, fix it!
BRIAN: You should really fix that.
John sits back down.
JOHN: Am I a genius?
ANDREW: No, you’re an asshole.
JOHN: What a funny guy.
ANDREW: Fix the door, Bender.
JOHN: Everyone just shh!
Cut in the hallway, Vernon returns and hears the conversation through the door.
JOHN: Listen, I’ve been here before, I know what I’m doing.
ANDREW: No, fix the door! Get up there and fix it!
JOHN: Shut up!
VERNON: Goddamn it!
He bursts in.
VERNON: Why is that door closed?
No one responds.
VENON: Why is that door closed?
JOHN: How are we supposed to know? We’re not supposed to move, right?
Vernon looks at Claire.
VERNON: Why?
CLAIRE: We’re just sitting here, like we’re supposed to.
VERNON: Who closed that door?
JOHN: I think a screw fell out of it.
ANDREW: It just closed, sir.
VERNON: Who?
Allison squeals and slams her face on the table.
JOHN: She doesn’t talk, sir.
VERNON: Give me that screw.
JOHN: I don’t have it.
VERNON: You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you?
JOHN: I don’t have it. Screws fall out all the time. The world’s an imperfect place.
VERNON: Give it to me, Bender.
CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?
VERNON: Watch it, young lady.
Vernon leaves in a huff. He tries to open the door, but it falls shut. He grabs a chair.
JOHN: The door’s way too heavy, sir.
Vernon attempts to prop the door open with the chair, but the door still swings shut, swatting the chair out of the way. He shouts and the kids try to conceal their laughter. Vernon comes back in.
VERNON: Andrew Clark. Get up here. Come on, front and center. Let’s go.
Andrew sighs and gets up.
JOHN: Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
Vernon instructs Andrew to help him carry a large shelving unit to the door.
JOHN: If he gets up we’ll all get up. It’ll be anarchy!
VERNON: Okay, watch it, watch the magazines.
The carry the unit through the door.
JOHN: It’s out of my hands.
With the door propped open, Andrew clumsily tries to get back inside, but slips. Vernon tries to help him up.
JOHN: That’s very clever, sir. But what if there’s a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir.
VERNON: Alright, what are you doing with this? What are you doing with this? Get out of here, for god’s sake. What’s the matter with you? Come on.
BRIAN: Well, you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library.
JOHN: Show Dick some respect.
Vernon prods Andrew back to the seats.
VERNON: Let’s go. Go, get back in your seat.
Andrew sits down.
VERNON: I expected a little more from a varsity letterman. You’re not fooling anybody, Bender. The next screw that falls out is going to be you.
JOHN: (Muttering) Eat my shorts.
VERNON: What was that?
JOHN: Eat my shorts.
VERNON: You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister.
JOHN: Oh, I’m crushed.
VERNON: You just bought one more right there.
JOHN: Well, I’m free the Saturday after that. Beyond that, I’m going to have to check my calendar.
VERNON: Good, because it’s going to be filled! We’ll keep going. You want another one? Say the word, just say the word. Instead of going to prison you’ll come here. Are you through?
JOHN: No.
VERNON: I’m doing society a favor.
JOHN: So?
VERNON: That’s another one, right now. I’ve got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don’t watch your step. You want another one?
JOHN: Yes.
VERNON: You got it! You got another one right there. That’s another one, pal.
CLAIRE: Cut it out!
She mouths stop at him.
VERNON: You through?
JOHN: Not even close, bud.
VERNON: Good, you got one more right there.
JOHN: You really think I give a shit?
VERNON: Another.
John just stares.
VERNON: You through?
JOHN: How many is that?
BRIAN: That’s seven including when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet.
VERNON: Now it’s eight. You stay out of it.
BRIAN: Excuse me, sir, it’s seven.
VERNON: Shut up, Pee Wee.
Vernon holds up two fingers.
VERNON: You’re mine, Bender. For two months I got you. I got you.
JOHN: What can I say? I’m thrilled.
VERNON: Oh, I’m sure that’s exactly what you want these people to believe. You know something, Bender? You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people. You might be better off. Alright, that’s it. I’m going to be right outside those doors. The next time I have to come in here, I’m cracking skulls.
He walks out, holding two fingers up to John one last time before the door closes. Noise builds up.
JOHN: Fuck you! Fuck.
Cut to a close up of a clock which shows 7:45. John strikes a match on his shoe and uses it to light a cigarette. Claire stares off into the distance. Brian covers his crotch with his hat. Andrew plays with the strings on his hoodie. Allison holds up a string. John hits the fire on his shoe, putting it out. Allison ties the string around her finger, cutting off circulation to the tip. John plays air-guitar. Allison draws a detailed piece of art. Andrew plays paper football. Allison scratches her hair, getting dandruff all over her drawing. The kids all struggle to stay awake. Cut to Vernon staring at them all with contempt.
VERNON: Wake up!
None of the kids respond.
VERNON: Who has to go to the lavatory?
The kids all raise their hands. Cut to the clock again, now a little past 10:20. John sits on a desk ripping something up. Brian stands nearby reading something. Andrew stretches his leg on a railing. Claire sits, looking bored. John throws papers everywhere.
ANDREW: That’s real intelligent.
JOHN: You’re right. It’s wrong to destroy literature. It’s such fun to read. And…
He reads the name of the author off of the book he’s ripping up.
JOHN: “Mollay” really pumps my nads.
Claire smiles at John.
CLAIRE: Molière.
Classical music plays.
BRIAN: I love his work.

John angrily throws paper at Brian and puts the book down.
JOHN: Big deal. Nothing to do when you’re locked in a vacancy.
He picks up a drawer of index cards.
ANDREW: Ah, speak for yourself.
JOHN: Do you think I’d speak for you? I don’t even know your language.
Andrew turns away from John to Claire.
ANDREW: Hey, you grounded tonight?
CLAIRE: I don’t know. My mom said I was, but my dad told me just to blow her off.
Andrew gives a pointed look to John before continuing.
ANDREW: There’s a big party at Stubby’s. Parents are in Europe. Should be pretty wild.
CLAIRE: Yeah?
ANDREW: Yeah, you gonna go?
CLAIRE: I doubt it.
ANDREW: How come?
CLAIRE: Well, cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it’s because my father says it’s okay. It’s this whole big monster deal. It’s endless. It’s a total drag. It’s like any minute, divorce.
JOHN: Who do you like better?
CLAIRE: What?
JOHN: You like your old man better than your mom?
CLAIRE: They’re both screwed.
JOHN: No, I mean, if you had to choose between them.
CLAIRE: I don’t know. Probably go live with my brother. I mean, I don’t think either one of them gives a shit about me. It’s like they use me just to get back at each other.
ALLISON: Ha!
Claire, John, and Brian look at Allison in confusion. Andrew smiles. Allison blows hair out of her own face.
CLAIRE: Shut up.
ANDREW: You’re just feeling sorry for yourself.
CLAIRE: Yeah, well, if I didn’t, nobody else would.
ANDREW: Aw, you’re breaking my heart.
JOHN: Sporto?
ANDREW: What?
John hops down from the desk.
JOHN: You get along with your parents?
ANDREW: Well, if I say yes I’m an idiot, right?
John hops over the railing in front of Andrew.
JOHN: You’re an idiot anyway. But if you say you get along with your parents, well you’re a liar too.
John walks away. Andrew follows and shoves him from behind.
ANDREW: You know something, man? If we weren’t in school right now I’d waste you.
John holds up his hand.
JOHN: Can you hear this? You want me to turn it up?
He turns his hand up, flipping off Andrew. Brian walks into frame and tries to get between them.
BRIAN: Hey, fellas, I mean-
He reaches his arms around them, but they both shove him off. Andrew takes a few steps away.
BRIAN: I don’t, I don’t like my parents either, I mean, I don’t, you know, I don’t, I don’t get along with them, and their idea of, you know, parental compassion is just, you know, whacko, you know?
JOHN: Dork?
BRIAN: Yeah?
JOHN: You are a parent’s wet dream, okay?
He pats Brian, who stumbles back onto a desk.
BRIAN: Well, that’s the problem.
JOHN: Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes, but face it. You’re a neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie. What would you be doing if you weren’t out making yourself a better citizen?
ANDREW: Why do you have to insult everybody?
JOHN: I’m being honest, asshole. I would expect you to know the difference.
ANDREW: Yeah, well he’s got a name.
JOHN: Yeah?
ANDREW: Yeah. What’s your name?
BRIAN: Brian.
ANDREW: See?
JOHN: My condolences.
CLAIRE: What's your name?
JOHN: What's yours?
CLAIRE: Claire.
JOHN: Claire?
CLAIRE: Claire. It's a family name.
JOHN: No, it's a fat girl's name.
CLAIRE: Oh, thank you.
JOHN: You're welcome.
CLAIRE: I'm not fat.
JOHN: Well, not at present, but I could see you really pushing maximum density. You see, I'm not sure if you know this, but there are two kinds of fat people. There's fat people that were born to be fat, and there's fat people that were once thin, but they became fat, so when you look at them you can sort of see that thin person inside. You see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh…
He imitates bloating up. She flips him off.
JOHN: Oh, obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.
CLAIRE: I'm not that pristine.
He leans in closer.
JOHN: Are you a virgin? I'll bet you a million dollars that you are. Let's end the suspense. Is it gonna be a...white weddin'?
CLAIRE: Why don't you just shut up?
JOHN: Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth? Have you ever been felt up, over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off, hoping to God your parents don't walk in?
CLAIRE: Do you want me to puke?
JOHN: Over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on the front seat past 11:00 on a school night?
ANDREW: Leave her alone.
John doesn’t move. Andrew walks closer.
ANDREW: I said, leave her alone.
JOHN: You gonna make me?
ANDREW: Yeah.
John walks closer.
JOHN: You and how many of your friends?
ANDREW: Just me. Just you and me. Two hits. Me hitting you, you hitting the floor. Anytime you're ready, pal.
John shoves Andrew. Andrew grabs John’s arm and pins him to the ground.
JOHN: I don't want to get into this with you, man.
Andrew gets off of him.
ANDREW: Why not?
JOHN: Because I'd kill you. It's real simple: I'd kill you, and your fucking parents would sue me, and it'd be a big mess, and I don't care enough about you to bother.
He backs up as he talks.
ANDREW: Chickenshit.
Andrew turns away, but looks back when he hears John pull out a switchblade. John stabs it into a chair.
ANDREW: Let's end this right now. You don't talk to her-
Allison takes John’s knife.
ANDREW: -you don't look at her, and you don't even think about her! You understand me?
JOHN: I'm trying to help her.
Cut to Carl the janitor entering. He empties a trash near the kids.
CARL: Hey, Brian, how you doing?
JOHN: Your dad work here?
Andrew smirks.
JOHN: Uh, Carl?
CARL: What?
JOHN: Can I ask you a question?
CARL: Sure.
JOHN: How does one become a janitor?
CARL: You want to be a janitor?
JOHN: No, I just want to know how one becomes a janitor, because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts.
CARL: Oh, really? You guys think I'm just some untouchable peasant? Serf? Peon? Huh? Maybe so. But following a broom around after shitheads like you for the last eight years, I've learned a couple of things. I look through your letters. I look through your lockers. I listen to your conversations: you don't know that but I do. I am the eyes and ears of this institution, my friends.
He turns to leave and checks his watch.
CARL: By the way, that clock's 20 minutes fast.
John smiles as Carl leaves. Cut to Vernon in his office. He sees the clock reach 11:30 and gets up. In the detention room, John whistles with a bandana on his head. The rest of the kids join in. They stop when Vernon enters. John switches to a different tune.
VERNON: Alright, girls. That’s thirty minutes for lunch.
ANDREW: Here?
VERNON: Here.
ANDREW: Well, I think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in, sir.
VERNON: Well, I don’t care what you think, Andrew.
JOHN: Uh, Dick- excuse me, Rich. Will milk be made available to us?
ANDREW: We’re extremely thirsty, sir.
CLAIRE: I have a really low tolerance for dehydration.
ANDREW: I’ve seen her dehydrate, sir. It’s pretty gross.
JOHN: Relax, I’ll get it.
John begins to get up.
VERNON: Ah, ah, ah. Grab some wood there, bub. What, do you think I was born yesterday? You think I’m going to have you roaming these halls? You.
He looks at Andrew. Andrew gestures to Claire.
VERNON: And you.
Vernon points to Allison. She doesn’t notice.
VERNON: Hey! What’s her name? Wake her, wake her up. Hey, come on, on your feet, missy. Let’s go. This is no rest home.
Allison grabs her bag and gets up.
VERNON: There’s a soft drink machine in the teacher’s lounge. Let’s go.
Andrew gets up. Cut to Andrew and Allison walking down the halls. Allison keeps a distance a few steps behind him.
ANDREW: So, what’s your poison? What do you drink?
She says nothing.
ANDREW: Okay, forget I asked.
They walk in silence for a moment.
ALLISON: Vodka.
ANDREW: Vodka. When do you drink vodka?
ALLISON: Whenever.
She moves up a step ahead of him.
ANDREW: A lot?
ALLISON: Tons.
ANDREW: Is that why you’re here today? Why are you here?
ALLISON: Why are you here?
He takes a moment and backs up.
ANDREW: Um… I’m here today because, uh… Because my coach and my father don’t want me to blow my ride. See, I get treated differently because, uh, coach thinks I’m a winner. So does my old man. I’m not a winner because I want to be one. I’m a winner because I got strength and speed, kind of like a racehorse. That’s about how involved I am in what’s happening to me.
ALLISON: Yeah. That’s very interesting. Now, why don’t you tell me why you’re really in here.
ANDREW: Forget it.
Back in the detention room, John is watching Claire. She rotates around a statue in the middle of the room. Brian is sitting near John, also watching her.
JOHN: Claire? You want to see a picture of a guy with elephantitis of the nuts? It’s pretty tasty.
CLAIRE: No, thank you.
JOHN: How do you think he rides a bike?
She just glares at him.
JOHN: Oh, Claire, would you ever consider dating a guy like this?
CLAIRE: Can’t you just leave me alone?
JOHN: I mean, if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car. Although, you’d probably have to ride in the backseat because his nuts would ride shotgun.
CLAIRE: You know what I wish I was doing?
JOHN: Watch what you say. Brian here is a cherry.
BRIAN: A cherry?
CLAIRE: I wish I was in a plane to France.
BRIAN: I’m not a cherry.
JOHN: When have you ever gotten laid?
BRIAN: I’ve laid lots of times.
JOHN: Name one.
BRIAN: She lives in Canada. Met her at Niagara Falls. You wouldn’t know her.
JOHN: Ever laid anyone around here?
Brian gestures to Claire.
JOHN: Oh, you and Claire did it.
CLAIRE: What are you talking about?
BRIAN: Nothing, nothing. Let’s just drop it, okay? We’ll talk about it later.
CLAIRE: No, drop what? What are you talking about?
JOHN: Well, Brian’s trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagara Falls area, that presently you and he are riding the hobby horse.
CLAIRE: You little pig.
BRIAN: No, I’m not. I’m n- John said I was a cherry and I said I wasn’t. That’s it. That’s all that was said.
JOHN: Well, then what were you motioning to Claire for?
CLAIRE: You know, I don’t appreciate this very much, Brian.
BRIAN: He is lying.
JOHN: Oh, you weren’t motioning to Claire?
BRIAN: You know he’s lying, right?
JOHN: Were you or were you not motioning to Claire?
BRIAN: Yeah, but it was only because I didn’t want her to know I was a virgin, okay? Excuse me for being a virgin, I’m sorry.
CLAIRE: Why didn’t you want me to know you were a virgin?
BRIAN: Because it’s personal business. It’s my personal private business.
JOHN: Well, Brian, it doesn’t sound like you’re doing any business.
CLAIRE: I think it’s okay for a guy to be a virgin.
BRIAN: You do?
Cut to Claire, John, and Andrew sitting at a table. Some drinks are spread out on the table. Claire and Andrew are opening bags of food.
JOHN: What’s in there?
CLAIRE: Guess. Where’s your lunch?
JOHN: You’re wearing it.
CLAIRE: You’re nauseating.
John grabs a drink and tosses it to Allison, who’s looking at an album. Claire takes out her lunch.
JOHN: What’s that?
CLAIRE: Sushi.
JOHN: Sushi?
CLAIRE: Rice, raw fish, and seaweed.
JOHN: You won’t accept a guy’s tongue in your mouth and you’re gonna eat that?
CLAIRE: Can I eat?
JOHN: I don’t know. Give it a try.
Andrew takes out his lunch, which has substantially more food than anyone else’s. Allison opens her drink which fizzes over, and she slurps up what spills. Brian looks at her. Andrew notices Claire and John staring at him.
ANDREW: What’s your problem?
Allison takes apart her sandwich, tossing the meat at the statue in the middle of the room. She pours a large amount of sugar all over her food and begins mashing it all up as the others stare. She notices them as she takes a bite. John moves over to Brian and takes his food.
JOHN: What are we having?
BRIAN: Uh, just your standard regular lunch, I guess.
John reaches in and pulls out a thermos.
JOHN: Milk?
BRIAN: Soup.
John reaches in the bag again. Brian reaches over, but John slaps his hand away. He pulls out a juice box.
BRIAN: That’s apple juice.
JOHN: I can read. PB&J with the crusts cut off. Well, Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. All the food groups are represented. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?
BRIAN: Uh, no. Mr. Johnson.
JOHN: Ah. Here's my impression of life at Big Bri's house.
He gets up and begins acting out a scene.
JOHN: ""Son?"" ""Yeah, Dad?"" ""How was your day, pal?"" ""Great, Dad! How's yours?"" ""Super! Say, son, how’d you like to go fishing this weekend?"" ""Great, Dad! But I got homework to do."" ""That's okay, son! You can do it on the boat!"" ""Gee!"" ""Dear, isn't our son swell?"" ""Yes, dear. Isn't life swell?""
He mimes Brian’s parents kissing each other, then punching one of them. Andrew sees Brian’s face fall.
ANDREW: All right, what about your family?
JOHN: What, mine?
ANDREW: Yeah.
JOHN: It’s real easy.
He gets up and acts out another scene.
JOHN: ""Stupid, worthless, no good, goddamned, free loading son-of-a-bitch! Retarded, big mouth, know-it-all asshole jerk!"" ""You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful!"" ""Shut up, bitch! Go fix me a turkey pot pie!"" ""What about you, Dad?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?!"" ""Fuck you!""
He mimes getting punched by his dad.
BRIAN: Is that for real?
JOHN: You wanna come over some time?
ANDREW: That's bullshit. It's all part of your image; I don't believe a word of it.
JOHN: You don't believe me?
ANDREW: No.
JOHN: No?
ANDREW: Did I stutter?
John walks over to Andrew. He pulls up his sleeve and shows Andrew a burn mark on his arm.
JOHN: Believe this? Huh? It's about the size of a cigar. Do I stutter? You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage. See, I don't think that I need to sit with you fuckin' dildos anymore!
He walks away, swiping some books off of a desk in anger. He climbs up some stairs and takes a moment to breathe.
CLAIRE: You shouldn’t have said that.
ANDREW: How did I know? I mean, he lies about everything anyway.
Cut to Vernon eating lunch in his office. He spills his drink all over his desk.
VERNON: Oh, shit.
He walks out of his office.
VERNON: Coffee. Probably scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi River. Everything’s polluted. The coffee’s polluted.
As Vernon rounds a corner, the kids exit the detention room. He enters the bathroom while the kids walk the halls.
CLAIRE: How do you know where Vernon went?
JOHN: I don’t.
CLAIRE: Well, then how do you know when he’ll be back?
JOHN: I don’t. Being bad feels pretty good, huh?
BRIAN: What’s the point of going to Bender’s locker?
ANDREW: Beats me.
BRIAN: This is so stupid. Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught?
ANDREW: I don’t know.
BRIAN: So then, what are we doing?
ANDREW: You ask me one more question and I’m beating the shit out of you.
BRIAN: Sorry.
Cut to John’s locker. He opens it.
ANDREW: You’re such a slob.
JOHN: My maid’s on vacation.
He takes out a bag. He pulls another bag out of it, and then a third bag out of the second. Finally, he pulls a bag of weed out. Brian sniffs.
BRIAN: Drugs.
ANDREW: Screw that, Bender. Put it back.
BRIAN: Drugs. The boy has marijuana.
John walks away, then Claire.
BRIAN: That was marijuana.
ANDREW: Shut up, dick.
Andrew follows.
BRIAN: Do you approve of this?
Allison doesn’t respond. Brian turns and follows the others. Allison steals the lock off of John’s locker. Cut to John and Andrew walking in unison.
JOHN: We’ll cross through the lab, and then we’ll double back.
ANDREW: You better be right. If Vernon cuts us off, it’s your fault, asshole.
BRIAN: What’d he say? Where are we going?
As the kids come around a corner, they see Vernon heading back to the detention room. They scramble around various hallways as music plays, often being barely missed by Vernon.
JOHN: Wait, wait, hold it, hold it. We have to go through the cafeteria.
ANDREW: No, the activities hall.
JOHN: Hey, man, you don’t know what you’re talking about.
ANDREW: No, you don’t know what you’re talking about! Now, we’re through listening to you. We’re going this way. You go where you want, mother hen.
Andrew runs off. Brian and Claire follow. Allison looks at John for a moment before they both follow the others. Vernon walks slowly to where the kids just were. They kids find themselves blocked by a gate.
ANDREW: Shit.
JOHN: Great idea, jagoff.
ANDREW: Fuck you!
CLAIRE: Fuck you! Why didn’t you listen to John?
BRIAN: We’re dead.
JOHN: No, just me.
BRIAN: What do you mean?
JOHN: Get back to the library.
He shoves the weed in Brian’s pants.
JOHN: Keep your unit out of it.
John runs down the hallway, yelling.
JOHN: I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!
Elsewhere, Vernon hears John in the distance.
VERNON: That son of a bitch!
Vernon runs off. We see shots of each of them running through hallways.
JOHN: Before the day I die, there’s some things I want to buy! Light bulbs, light bulbs, automobile, and a Ferris wheel! I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!
Vernon turns a corner, out of breath. He hears a sound in the distance. Cut to John in the gymnasium, playing with a basketball.
JOHN: Ah! Three, two, one!
He makes a slam dunk. Vernon walks in.
JOHN: Big applause!
VERNON: Bender! What is this? What are you doing here? What is this?
JOHN: Hi.
John dribbles.
VERNON: Out! That’s it, Bender. Out, it’s over.
JOHN: Don’t you want to hear my excuse?
VERNON: Out!
JOHN: I’m thinking of trying out for a scholarship.
VERNON: Give me the ball, Bender. Give me that ball.
John does two fake outs before rolling the ball over gently. Vernon kicks it at him. They both exit the gymnasium. Cut back to the detention room.
VERNON: Get your stuff, let’s go.
Vernon shoves John towards the tables.
VERNON: Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon himself to go to the gymnasium. I’m sorry to inform you you’re going to be without his services for the rest of the day.
JOHN: B-O-O-H-O-O.
VERNON: Everything’s a big joke, huh, Bender? The false alarm you pulled Friday, false alarms are really funny, aren’t they? What if your home, what if your family… What if your dope was on fire?
JOHN: Impossible, sir. It’s in Johnson’s underwear.
Andrew chuckles.
VERNON: Oh, you think he’s funny? You think this is cute? You think he’s bitchin’? Is that it? Let me tell you something. Look at him. He’s a bum. You wanna see something funny? You go visit John Bender in five years, you’ll see how goddamn funny he is.
Vernon walks over to John.
VERNON: What’s the matter, John? You gonna cry? Let’s go.
Vernon grabs John’s arm. John gets up and shakes him off.
JOHN: Hey, keep your fucking hands off me! I expect better manners from you, Dick.
John walks away. He sets sunglasses down in front of Andrew.
JOHN: For better hallway vision.
John knocks things off of a desk as he leaves, followed by Vernon. Cut to the two of them in a closet.
VERNON: That’s the last time, Bender. That’s the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids, do you hear me? I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year and I’ve got a home, and I’m not about to throw it away on some punk like you. But someday, man, someday when you’re out of here and you’ve forgotten all about this place, and they’ve forgotten all about you, and you’re wrapped up in your own pathetic life, I’m gonna be there. That’s right. And I’m gonna kick the living shit out of you, man. I’m going to knock your dick in the dirt.
JOHN: You threatening me?
VERNON: What’re you gonna do about it? You think anybody’s gonna believe you? You think anybody is gonna take your word over mine? I’m a man of respect around here. They love me around here. I’m a swell guy. You’re a lying sack of shit and everybody knows it. Oh, you’re a tough guy. Hey, hey, come on, come on. Get on your feet, pal. Let’s find out how tough you are. I wanna know right now how tough you are. Come on, I’ll give you the first punch. Let’s go, come on. Right here. Just take the first shot. Please, I’m begging you. Take a shot right here, come on. Just take one shot. That’s all I need. Just one swing.
John doesn’t do anything. Vernon backs off. He goes for a fake out and John flinches.
VERNON: That’s what I thought. You’re a gutless turd.
Vernon exits, locking the door on his way out. Cut to him entering the bathroom, then back to the closet. The camera pans up a stack of objects and then to a roof tile sliding into place. Cut to John making his way above the ceiling, crawling on all fours.
JOHN: A naked blonde walks into a bar with a poodle under one arm and a two-foot salami under the other. She lays the poodle on the table. Bartender says, ""I suppose you won't be needing a drink."" Naked lady says- Oh, shit!
He falls through the ceiling into the detention room.
VERNON: Jesus Christ Almighty!
The other kids look on in shock as John falls and then makes his way down the stairs to the main table area.
JOHN: Forgot my pencil.
He walks over to his seat.
VERNON: Goddamn it!
Vernon enters. John is nowhere to be seen.
VERNON: What in god's name is goin' on in here? What was that ruckus?
The kids just shrug.
ANDREW: Uh, what ruckus?
VERNON: I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus.
BRIAN: Could you describe the ruckus, sir?
VERNON: Watch your tongue, young man, watch it.
Under the table in front of Claire, John hits his head. Andrew hits along in a rhythm.
VERNON: What is this?
Andrew makes a zipper sound.
VERNON: What is that? What, what is that, what is that noise?
Under the table, John stares at Claire’s panties.
ANDREW: What noise?
CLAIRE: Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.
As John moves closer, she crushes his head between her knees. He cries out. Claire pretends to sneeze to cover. The other students cough along.
CLAIRE: That noise? Was that the noise that you're talking about?
VERNON: No, it wasn't. That was not the noise I was talking about. Now, I may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet I will.
Allison laughs.
VERNON: You make book on that, Missy. And you!
He points to Claire.
VERNON: I will not be made a fool of.
Vernon walks away. Toilet paper liner is stuck to the back of his pants. As the door slams shut, Andrew, Brian, and Allison crack up. Claire kicks John and scoots her chair back. She keeps hitting him as he gets out from under the table
JOHN: It was an accident.
CLAIRE: You’re an asshole.
JOHN: Sue me.
He walks over to Brian.
JOHN: So, Ahab, can I have all my doobage?
Brian pulls out the weed and hands it to John.
ANDREW: Yo, wasteoid. You’re not going to blaze up in here.
John ignores him. Claire looks at Andrew, who shakes his head. She gets up and follows John anyway. Brian awkwardly clears his throat. He mouths a question and Andrew, who shakes his head. Biran looks around for a moment and then walks to the back. Andrew turns away and looks agitated.
ANDREW: Shit.
He grabs his sunglasses and gets up. Allison watches. Cut to Vernon, who enters the basement. Cut back to the detention room. Brian is wearing the sunglasses. He, John, and Claire giggle. John lights a match with his teeth and lights the blunt in Claire’s mouth. She coughs. John laughs. Brian pretends to eat the smoke from his blunt. Brian begins doing an impression.
BRIAN: Chicks cannot hold their smoke. That’s what it is.
John chuckles
CLAIRE: Do you know how popular I am? I’m so popular, everybody loves me so much at this school.
BRIAN: Poor baby.
Allison stares slack-jawed at the others from her table.
BRIAN: Five.
He holds up his hand. John gives him a forceful high-five, pushing him backwards. His legs go up in the air. Claire laughs. Andrew exits a nearby smoke-filled room smoking a blunt. He takes off his jacket and starts dancing around.
ANDREW: Woo!
He does a cart-wheel as he goes, then a barrel-roll. He takes off his shirt and swings it around, throwing it down. Brian whistles. Andrew pretends to hit himself and then keeps running around the perimeter of the second floor. Brian, laughing, hits Claire, who yelps. Andrew makes his way back to the smoke-filled room and walks in closing the door. He yells, and the glass on the door’s window shatters. Cut to Vernon, who’s reading files.
VERNON: Mr… Oh, Mr. Tierney. A history of slight mental illness.
Carl walks in.
VERNON: No wonder he’s so fucked up.
CARL: Afternoon, Dick.
Vernon looks up and puts the file he’s reading down.
VERNON: Hey, Carl, how you doing?
CARL: Good.
VERNON: Good, what’s up?
CARL: Not much. What’s happening? What are you doing in the basement files?
VERNON: Oh, nothing, nothing here. I’m just doing a little homework here.
CARL: Homework, huh?
Carl walks closer.
VERNON: Yeah.
CARL: Confidential files, huh?
VERNON: Well, look, Carl, this is a highly sensitive area, and I, I tell you something, certain people would be very, very embarrassed. I would really appreciate it if this would be something that you and I could keep between us.
CARL: What are you gonna do for me, man?
VERNON: What would you like?
CARL: You got fifty bucks?
VERNON: What?
CARL: Fifty bucks.
Cut back to the detention room. Brian and Andrew are sitting in chairs and laughing.
ANDREW: No, no, man, no. You got a middle name?
BRIAN: Yeah, guess.
ANDREW: Uh-
Allison begins walking over.
ALLISON: Your middle name is Ralph, as in, puke. Your birth date’s March 12th, you’re five-nine and a half, you weigh 130 pounds and your social security number is 049-38-0913.
She sits near Brian.
ANDREW: Wow, are you psychic?
ALLISON: No.
BRIAN: Well, would you mind telling me how you know all this about me?
She pulls out a wallet from her bag.
ALLISON: I stole your wallet.
BRIAN: Give it to me.
ALLISON: No.
BRIAN: Give it.
She tosses it down.
BRIAN: This is great, you’re a thief too, huh?
ALLISON: I’m not a thief.
ANDREW: Multi-talented.
ALLISON: What’s there to steal? Two bucks and a beaver shot.
ANDREW: A what?
ALLISON: He’s got a nudie picture in there. I saw it. It’s perverted.
ANDREW: Alright, let’s see it.
John brushes his teeth. Claire reads a clip of IDs.
CLAIRE: Are all these your girlfriends?
JOHN: Some of them.
CLAIRE: What about the others?
JOHN: Well, some I consider my girlfriends and some I just consider.
CLAIRE: Consider what?
JOHN: Whether or not I want to hang out with them.
CLAIRE: You don’t believe in just one guy, one girl?
JOHN: Do you?
CLAIRE: Yeah. That’s the way it should be.
JOHN: Not for me.
CLAIRE: Why not?
JOHN: How come you got so much shit in your purse?
CLAIRE: How come you have so many girlfriends?
JOHN: I asked you first.
CLAIRE: I don’t know. I guess I never throw anything away.
JOHN: Neither do I.
CLAIRE: Oh.
ANDREW: This is the worst fake ID I’ve ever seen. You realize you made yourself 68?
BRIAN: Oh, I know, I know, I goofed it.
ANDREW: What do you need a fake ID for?
BRIAN: So I can vote.
ALLISON: Want to see what’s in my bag?
ANDREW AND BRIAN: No.
She looks at them, then spills the contents of her bag all over the couch.
ANDREW: Holy shit. What is all that stuff?
BRIAN: Do you always carry this much shit in your bag?
ALLISON: Yeah. I always carry this much shit in my bag. You never know when you may have to jam.
BRIAN: Are you going to be like, a shopping bag lady? You know, like, sit in alleyways, and, like, talk to buildings and wear men’s shoes and that kind of thing?
ALLISON: I’ll do what I have to do.
BRIAN: Why do you have to do anything?
ALLISON: My home life is unsatisfying.
BRIAN: So you’re saying you’d subject yourself to the violent dangers of these Chicago streets because your home life is unsatisfying?
ALLISON: I don’t have to run away and live in the street. I can run away and I can go to the ocean. I can go to the country. I can go to the mountains. I can go to Israel, Africa, Afghanistan.
Brian leans over to Andrew.
BRIAN: Andy, you want to get in on this? Allison here says she wants to run away because her home life is unsatisfying.
ANDREW: Well, everyone’s home life is unsatisfying. And if it wasn’t, people would live with their parents forever.
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah. I understand, but I think hers goes beyond what, you know, guys like you and me consider normal unsatisfying.
ALLISON: Never mind, forget it, everything’s cool.
She begins packing stuff back in her bag.
ANDREW: What’s the deal?
ALLISON: No. There’s no deal, sporto. Forget it. Leave me alone.
ANDREW: Wait a minute. Now, you’re carrying all that crap around in your purse. Either you really want to run away or you want people to think you want to run away.
ALLISON: Eat shit.
She walks off.
BRIAN: The girl is an island with herself.
Andrew throws Brian’s wallet back at Brian and walks off towards Allison.
ANDREW: Hi. You want to talk?
ALLISON: No.
ANDREW: Why not?
ALLISON: Go away.
ANDREW: Where do you want me to go?
ALLISON: Go away!
After a few moments, he walks away.
ALLISON: You have problems.
ANDREW: Oh, I have problems?
ALLISON: You do everything everybody ever tells you to do! That is a problem.
ANDREW: Okay, fine. But I didn’t dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems, did I?
He walks closer to her.
ANDREW: So what’s wrong? What is it? Is it bad? Real bad? Parents?
ALLISON: Yeah.
ANDREW: What did they do to you?
ALLISON: They ignore me.
ANDREW: Yeah. Yeah.
Cut to Vernon and Carl.
VERNON: What did you want to be when you were young?
CARL: When I was a kid I wanted to be John Lennon.
VERNON: Carl, don’t be a goof. I’m trying to make a serious point here. Carl, I’ve been teaching for twenty two years, and each year these kids get more and more arrogant.
CARL: Oh, bullshit, man. Come on, Vern. The kids haven’t changed, you have. You took a teaching position because you thought it’d be fun, right? Thought you could have summer vacations off? And then you found out it was actually work. That really bummed you out.
Vernon shakes his head.
VERNON: These kids turned on me. They think I’m a big fucking joke.
CARL: Come on. Listen, Vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you?
VERNON: Hey, Carl, you think I give one rat’s ass what these kids think of me?
CARL: Yes, I do.
VERNON: You think about this. When you get old, these kids, when I get old, they’re gonna be running the country.
CARL: Yeah.
VERNON: Now, this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night, that when I get older, these kids are gonna take care of me.
CARL: I wouldn't count on it.
Back in the detention room, all five kids are seated on the floor.
ANDREW: What would I do for a million bucks? I guess I’d do as little as I had to.
CLAIRE: That’s boring.
ANDREW: Well, how am I supposed to answer?
CLAIRE: The idea is to, like, search your mind for the absolute limit. Like, um… Would you drive to school naked?
He laughs.
ANDREW: Uh, would I have to get out of the car?
CLAIRE: Of course.
ANDREW: In the spring? Or winter?
CLAIRE: Doesn’t matter. Spring.
ANDREW: In front of the school or in back of the school?
CLAIRE: Either one.
ANDREW: Yes.
ALLISON: I’d do that. I’ll do anything sexual. I don’t need a million dollars to do it, either.
CLAIRE: You’re lying.
ALLISON: I already have. I’ve done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal. I’m a nymphomaniac.
CLAIRE: Lie.
BRIAN: Are your parents aware of this?
ALLISON: The only person I told was my shrink.
ANDREW: What did he do when you told him?
ALLISON: He nailed me.
CLAIRE: Very nice.
ALLISON: I don’t think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since I paid him.
CLAIRE: He’s an adult.
ALLISON: Yeah, he’s married, too.
CLAIRE: Ugh. Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?
ALLISON: Well, the first few times-
CLAIRE: The first few times? You mean he did it more than once?
ALLISON: Sure.
CLAIRE: Are you crazy?
BRIAN: Obviously she’s crazy if she’s screwing a shrink.
ALLISON: Have you ever done it?
CLAIRE: I don’t even have a psychiatrist.
ALLISON: Have you ever done it with a normal person?
CLAIRE: Didn't we already cover this?
JOHN: You never answered the question.
CLAIRE: Look, I'm not going to discuss my private life with total strangers.
ALLISON: It's kind of a double edged sword, isn't it?
CLAIRE: A what?
ALLISON: Well, if you say you haven't, you're a prude. If you say you have, you're a slut. It's a trap. You want to but you can't, and when you do, you wish you didn't, right?
CLAIRE: Wrong.
ALLISON: Or are you a tease?
ANDREW: She's a tease.
CLAIRE: I'm sure. Why don't you just forget it.
ANDREW: Oh, you're a tease and you know it. All girls are teases.
JOHN: She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot.
CLAIRE: I don't do anything.
ALLISON: That's why you're a tease.
CLAIRE: Okay, let me ask you a few questions.
ALLISON: I already told you everything.
CLAIRE: No. Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love? I mean, don't you want any respect?
ALLISON: I don't screw to get respect. That's the difference between you and me.
CLAIRE: It's not the only difference I hope.
JOHN: Face it, you're a tease.
CLAIRE: I'm not a tease.
JOHN: Sure you are. Sex is your weapon. You said it yourself. You use it to get respect.
CLAIRE: No, I never said that. She twisted my words around.
JOHN: What do you use it for then?
CLAIRE: I don't use it period.
JOHN: Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?
CLAIRE: I didn't mean it that way. You guys are putting words into my mouth.
JOHN: Well, if you'd just answer the question.
BRIAN: Why don't you just answer the question?
ANDREW: Be honest.
JOHN: No big deal.
BRIAN: Yeah answer it.
ANDREW: Answer the question, Claire.
JOHN: Talk to us.
They all begin talking over each other, prodding her to answer the question.
JOHN: C'mon, it's easy. It's only one question.
CLAIRE: No, I never did it!
ALLISON: I never did it either. I'm not a nymphomaniac, I'm a compulsive liar.
CLAIRE: You are such a bitch. You did that on purpose just to fuck me over.
ALLISON: I would do it, though. If you love someone, it’s okay.
CLAIRE: I can’t believe you. You’re so weird. You don’t say anything all day and then when you open your mouth you unload all these tremendous lies all over me.
ANDREW: You’re just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn’t want to admit to.
CLAIRE: Okay, fine. But that doesn’t make it any less bizarre.
ANDREW: What's bizarre? I mean, we're all pretty bizarre! Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.
CLAIRE: How are you bizarre?
ALLISON: He can't think for himself.
ANDREW: She's right. Do you guys know what uh, what I did to get in here?
Claire shakes her head.
ANDREW: I taped Larry Lester's buns together.
BRIAN: That was you?
ANDREW: Yeah, you know him?
BRIAN: Yeah, I know him.
ANDREW: Well then, you know how hairy he is right? Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too.
CLAIRE: Oh, my god.
ANDREW: And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man. I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school, all the wild things he used to do. And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right? So, I'm, I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee, and Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me. And he's kinda, he's kinda skinny, weak. And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I, uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him. And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And, afterwards, when I was sitting in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and, and explain what happened to him. And the humiliation, fucking humiliation he must've felt. It must've been unreal. I mean, I mean, how do you apologize for something like that? There's no way. It's all because of me and my old man. God, I fucking hate him! He's like this, he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore. ""Andrew, you've got to be number one! I won't tolerate any losers in this family. Your intensity is for shit! Win! Win! Win!"" You son of a bitch. You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give, and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. And he could forget all about me.
JOHN: I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling.
BRIAN: It's like me, you know, with my grades. Like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know? And I see me. I don't like what I see. I really don't.
CLAIRE: What's wrong with you? Why don't you like yourself?
BRIAN: Sounds stupid, but… ‘Cause I'm failing shop. See, we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um, and we had eight weeks to do it and we're supposed to, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk, the light was supposed to go on. My light didn't go on. I got an F on it. Never got an F in my life. When I signed up, you know, for the course, I mean, I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. 'Cause I thought, ""I'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average.""
JOHN: Why'd you think it'd be easy?
BRIAN: Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?
JOHN: I take shop. You must be a fuckin' idiot.
BRIAN: I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't make a lamp?
JOHN: No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp.
BRIAN: What do you know about Trigonometry?
JOHN: I could care less about Trigonometry.
BRIAN: Bender, did you know without Trigonometry, there'd be no engineering?
JOHN: Without lamps, there'd be no light.
CLAIRE: Okay, so neither one of you is any better than the other one.
ALLISON: I can write with my toes. I can also eat, brush my teeth.
CLAIRE: With your feet?
ALLISON: Play Heart and Soul on the piano.
BRIAN: I can make spaghetti.
CLAIRE: What can you do?
ANDREW: I can tape all of your buns together.
JOHN: I want to see what Claire can do.
CLAIRE: I can’t do anything.
JOHN: No, everybody can do something.
CLAIRE: There’s one thing I can do… No, forget it. It’s way too embarrassing.
JOHN: You ever see “Wild Kingdom?” I mean, that guy’s been doing that show for thirty years.
CLAIRE: Okay. You have to swear to God you won’t laugh.
John motions a cross.
CLAIRE: Okay. I can’t believe I’m actually doing this.
She sticks a tube of lipstick between her breasts. She leans her head down and swings it either way. When she brings her head up, she’s successfully applied lipstick to her lips. The other kids clap.
ANDREW: Alright. Great. Where’d you learn to do that?
CLAIRE: Camp, seventh grade.
John keeps clapping.
JOHN: That was great, Claire.
She wipes the lipstick off.
JOHN: My image of you is totally blown.
ALLISON: You’re a shit. Don’t do that to her. You swore to God you wouldn’t laugh.
JOHN: Am I laughing?
ANDREW: You fucking prick.
JOHN: What do you care what I think anyway? I don’t even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn’t make any difference. I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? And you don’t like me anyway.
CLAIRE: You know, I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them.
JOHN: God, you’re so pathetic. Don’t you ever, ever compare yourself to me, okay? You got everything and I got shit. Fucking Rapunzel, right? School would probably fucking shut down if you didn’t show up. Queenie isn’t here. I like those earrings, Claire.
CLAIRE: Shut up.
JOHN: Are those real diamonds, Claire?
CLAIRE: Shut up.
JOHN: I bet they are. Did you work for the money for those earrings?
CLAIRE: Shut your mouth.
JOHN: Or did your daddy buy those?
CLAIRE: Shut up!
JOHN: I bet he bought those for you. I bet those were a Christmas gift, right? You know what I got for Christmas this year? It was a banner fucking year at the old Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me and said, “Hey, smoke up, Johnny.” Okay? So go home and cry to your daddy. Don’t cry here, okay?
ANDREW: My God, are we gonna be like our parents?
CLAIRE: Not me. Ever.
ALLISON: It's unavoidable, it just happens.
CLAIRE: What happens?
ALLISON: When you grow up, your heart dies.
JOHN: Who cares?
ALLISON: I care.
BRIAN: I was thinking, I mean... I know it’s kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um… What is going to happen to us on Monday when we’re all together again? I mean, I consider you guys my friends. I’m not wrong, am I?
ANDREW: No.
BRIAN: So on Monday, what happens?
CLAIRE: Are we still friends, you mean? If we’re friends now, that is.
BRIAN: Yeah.
CLAIRE: Do you want the truth?
BRIAN: Yeah, I want the truth.
CLAIRE: I don’t think so.
ALLISON: With all of us? Or just John.
CLAIRE: With all of you.
ANDREW: That’s a real nice attitude, Claire.
CLAIRE: Oh, be honest, Andy. If Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean, picture this. You’re there with all the sports. I know exactly what you’d do. You’d say hi to him, and when he left, you’d cut him all up so your friends wouldn’t think that you really liked him.
ANDREW: No way.
ALLISON: What if I came up to you?
CLAIRE: Same exact thing.
JOHN: You are a bitch.
CLAIRE: Why, ‘cause I’m telling the truth? That makes me a bitch?
JOHN: No, ‘cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone, and you don’t got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell them that you’re going to like who you want to like.
CLAIRE: Okay, what about you, you hypocrite? Why don’t you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties?
Allison chuckles.
CLAIRE: Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high, or what about Andy for that matter? What about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together? They’d laugh their asses off. And you’d probably tell them that you were doing it with me so they’d forgive you for being seen with me.
JOHN: Don’t you ever talk about my friends. You don’t know any of my friends, you don’t look at any of my friends, and you certainly wouldn’t condescend to speak to any of my friends. So you just stick to the things that you know. Shopping, nail bolish, your father’s BMW, and your poor, rich, drunk mother in the Caribbean.
CLAIRE: Shut up!
JOHN: And as far as being concerned about what’s going to happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it, because it’s never going to happen. Just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fucking prom.
CLAIRE: I hate you.
JOHN: Yeah? Good.
BRIAN: Okay, then I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys, huh? Us weirdos. Would you… Would you do that to me?
ALLISON: I don’t have any friends.
BRIAN: Well, if you did.
ALLISON: No. I don’t think the kind of friends I’d have would mind.
BRIAN: I just wanna tell each of you that I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't and I will not! 'Cause I think that's real shitty.
CLAIRE: Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us.
BRIAN: You're so conceited, Claire. You're so conceited. You're so, like, full of yourself. Why are you like that?
CLAIRE: I'm not saying that to be conceited! I hate it! I hate having to go along with everything my friends say!
BRIAN: Well, then why do you do it?
CLAIRE: I don't know, I don't... You don't understand, you don't... You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with. You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you.
BRIAN: I don't understand what? You think I don't understand pressure, Claire? Well, fuck you! Fuck you!
Brian begins to cry into his sleeve.
BRIAN: Know why I'm here today? Do you? I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in my locker.
ANDREW: Why'd you have a gun in your locker?
BRIAN: I tried. You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on, and it didn't go on, I mean...
ANDREW: What's the gun for, Brian?
BRIAN: Just forget it.
ANDREW: You brought it up, man!
BRIAN: I can't have an F. I can't have it, and I know my parents can't have it. Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B. And everything's ruined for me.
CLAIRE: Brian…
He punches a chair nearby.
BRIAN: So I considered my options, you know?
CLAIRE: No, killing yourself is not an option.
BRIAN: Well I didn't do it, did I? No, I don't think so!
ALLISON: It was a handgun?
BRIAN: No, it was a flare gun. Went off in my locker.
ANDREW: Really?
Andrew begins to laugh.
BRIAN: It's not funny.
Andrew tries to stop himself but can’t contain his laughter. Allison and John try to hide their smiles. Brian starts to laugh after a moment as well.
BRIAN: Yes it is. Fuckin' elephant was destroyed!
ALLISON: You wanna know what I did to get in here? Nothing. I didn't have anything better to do.
Everyone begins to laugh.
ALLISON: You're laughing at me!
ANDREW: No!
ALLISON: Yeah, you are!
The laughter continues. Cut to Brian playing music on the radio in an office. Allison dances around the middle of the room. The camera follows her and we see John in the background shaking the statue while on top of it. Brian dances in the office. He throws some papers. Claire dances on the stairs. Andrew sits on a railing, drumming on his knee. A montage plays of the kids dancing in various ways and combinations. The montage ends and John makes his way back across the ceiling to the room he was locked in. the other four kids sit on a railing.
CLAIRE: Brian?
BRIAN: Hm?
CLAIRE: Are you going to write your paper?
BRIAN: Yeah, why?
CLAIRE: Well, it’s kind of a waste for all of us to write our paper, don’t you think?
BRIAN: Well, that’s what Vernon wants us to do.
CLAIRE: True, but I think we’d all kind of say the same thing.
BRIAN: You just don’t want to write your paper, right?
CLAIRE: True, but you’re the smartest, right?
BRIAN: Well, um.
CLAIRE: We trust you.
ANDREW: Yeah.
BRIAN: Alright. I’ll do it.
CLAIRE: Great.
Claire begins to stare at Allison. Allison stares back in response.
CLAIRE: Come on.
ALLISON: Where are we going?
CLAIRE Come on.
Claire gets up. Cut to a close up of Allison’s face as Claire does her makeup.
CLAIRE: Don’t be afraid.
ALLISON: Don’t stick that in my eye.
CLAIRE: I’m not sticking it, just close that- no, wait. Just go like that.
Claire makes a face. Allison copies it. Claire continues.
CLAIRE: Good. You know, you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes.
ALLISON: Hey, I like that black shit.
CLAIRE: This looks a lot better. Look up.
Brian sits at his desk, working on the paper. Andrew sits on a railing nearby. Claire continues with the makeup.
ALLISON: Please. Why are you being so nice to me?
CLAIRE: Cause you’re letting me.
Brian writes something down. John sits in the closet and looks up as the door opens. Claire enters.
JOHN: You lost?
Brian continues writing. Andrew looks up as Allison enters. She walks over. Andrew hops down from the railing. Brian looks up at her.
ALLISON: Thank you.
Back in the closet, Claire kisses John’s neck.
JOHN: Why’d you do that?
CLAIRE: ‘Cause I knew you wouldn’t.
JOHN: You know how you said before how your parents use you to get back at each other? Wouldn’t I be outstanding in that capacity?
CLAIRE: Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?
JOHN: Truth?
CLAIRE: Truth.
He nods.
JOHN: No.
Back in the detention room, Brian takes one last look at the paper and kisses it.
ANDREW: What happened to you?
ALLISON: Why? Claire did it.
He doesn’t say anything.
ALLISON: What’s wrong?
ANDREW: Nothing’s wrong. It’s just, you’re so different. I can see your face.
ALLISON: Is that good or bad?
ANDREW: It’s good.
She smiles. Brian gives himself a pat on the arm. Cut to the five of them walking through the hallway. They pass Carl on the way out.
CARL: See you Brian.
BRIAN: Hey, Carl.
JOHN: See you next Saturday.
CARL: You bet.
Cut to them exiting the building. Brian approaches his dad in the car. Andrew and Allison kiss. She rips a patch off of his jersey and walks to her car. Andrew’s dad pulls up. Andrew gets in the car. Claire gives John one of her earrings. He kisses her. She gets in the car and drives away. John puts on the earring she gave him. Cut to Vernon in the detention room reading Brian’s essay.
BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us: In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.
As the letter continues, John walks across a football field.
BRIAN: But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...
ANDREW: ...and an athlete...
ALLISON: ...and a basket case...
CLAIRE: ...a princess...
JOHN: ...and a criminal.
BRIAN: Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.
John throws a fist up into the air and the frame freezes.

Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
How you pull up? I pull up (Woo, SethInTheKitchen)

Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (Yeah, yeah)

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on

And I know you won't tell nobody no

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside

My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it

Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Half our friends are now are enemies
Now I-, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me
He used to meet me on the Eastside

You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Thought I found a way out (Found)

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine

Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'

Taking my sulkin' to the masses

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
Nuff pollution in the ends, I flew back yard cah I wanna see starlight

Don't drink, that's risky

That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs

How her boyfriend don't want her to win? Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?

Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (Darlin' miss me)
Oh God knows, I miss my bros

And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better than the summer
Of 2002 (Ooh)

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)

Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' ""bye, bye, bye""
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singin' at the top of both our lungs

Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holdin' each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (Ooh)
Yeah

Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' ""bye, bye, bye""
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go

I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex, though, the sex, though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)

Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
