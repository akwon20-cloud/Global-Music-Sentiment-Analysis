Strapped up with the guns and the swords and things

Uh, alright, I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent
We ain't got generational wealth

Now this gyal wan' me in her uterus, fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (Fuck it)

Take a look at these diamonds wrong, it's a life of squintin', can't just stare

Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta' password, I'll give you the pin to my Amex, huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum

She understand I can't take her everywhere a nigga going

I can hear your tеars when they drop over the phone
Get mad at yourself 'cause you can't leave me alone

Travel around the world (Would you cry or would you try to get me?)
Over the phone, dropping tears (Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah)

Looking to blame for what we lack

Can we forget what went wrong yesterday, darling

Girl I’m the streets I thought I could be discreet
But I messed up something sweet
Just what I need is some time to tell you please
I’m on my knees this was never meant to be
I did rubbish and it is just what it is
With a heart that’s full of need, and my lungs that barely breathe
You’re what I need I admit it, I admit
No one could еver love me bеtter than you did
No one could ever love me better than you did

One could have thought that this feeling would seize
But then I miss you laying in my sheets
Seh you no see as my heart e dey bleed

And for your heart I place the highest bid
Gimme an offer I just can’t resist

If I could take back what I did I would do it for sure
If could get you the world I would do it for you
It’s loyalty you deserve imma give it to you

Always been a lil' mathematician, lately, it's cash I'm gettin'
Got me losin' count of these bags, I've been movin' too fast
Hard times don't last, 'member when cops harassed
Talkin' out my ass, boy, you ain't shit but a bitch with a badge

But the media called me a menace
I done sat with the mayor and politicians, I'm tryna change the image
You can't blame my past no more, I come from the trenches
Some said I'd never be a superstar, but I know I'm different (No, no, no)
I'm The Voice, but the system ain't give me a choice
Know some people that's still unemployed
I know a felon who tryna get FOID
Child support your only support
For a visit, I'm goin' through courts
Went to jail, they was chainin' me up
And you know that I'm famous as fuck
See, how you gon' joke about stimulus?
But they really had came in the clutch
I know some kids wanna hurt theyself

Tryna better myself, tryna better my health but

First-generation ghetto nigga
Cole world, hello niggas
Made it out the city with my head on straight
Niggas keep shootin' up the lead out
Young Jordan Peele, gotta get out
And the shit that I spit out
Is a cheat code like I'm facin' a RICO
And how a nigga put a hit out
And another one, and, and another one
I got like a hundred of 'em
'Bout to lap niggas so they think they ahead of me
But I'm really in front of them
Now some of them fumblin' they bags
Fuckin' up the little crumbs that they had
A reminder to humble yourself
This shit could be gone in an instant
Me, I'm runnin' long distance, all pistons firin'
I been stuck between maybe retirin'
And feelin' like I'm just not hittin' my prime
These days seein' rappers be dyin'
Way before they even gettin' they shine
I never even heard of lil' buddy
'Til somebody murdered lil' buddy
Now I'm on the phone, searchin' lil' buddy name
Got to playin' his tunes
All day in my room, thinkin', ""Damn
This shit wicked, to get they names buzzin'
Some niggas just gotta go lay in a tomb""
And media thirsty for clicks
I got a new rule
If you ain't never posted a rapper when he was alive
You can't post about him after he get hit
It's simple, it's the principle
On any tempo, I'm invincible
Don't even rap, I just vent to you
I rather that than an interview most days
Fuck 'em all like I'm goin' through a ho phase
Young nigga shoot out the whip like road rage
I pray all of my dawgs stay so paid
And the only thing that kill 'em is old age

If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another five years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no

Send me the location
This year about vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend’s on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can't see ’cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting
See Dave LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like

And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another five years
Me bring girls to his location
No time, no

Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweetest nani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, parred me, I'm laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an ’18 plate, man's parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I’m far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don't want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60’s vets
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation
Another five years
Me bring girls to his location

Nigga I was down but I made it to the top right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
Yeah I'm so fly, yeah I'm flyer than a rocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you playin' affi stop right now
(Right now, right now, right now)

I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
Now mi have nuff gyal bellin up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave a big fat spliff burnin' up
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make ah live my life, ah
Nigga I was down but I made it to the top right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And I can pull a couple grand out my pocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
Yeah I'm so fly, yeah I'm flyer than a rocket right now
(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you playin' affi stop right now
