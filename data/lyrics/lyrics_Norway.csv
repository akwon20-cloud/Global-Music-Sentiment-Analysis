0,Lewis Capaldi - Someone You Loved,"222 ContributorsTranslationsSvenskaEspañolPortuguêsDeutschNederlandsFrançaisTürkçeالعربيةSomeone You Loved Lyrics
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved168Embed"

Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm fallin'
In all the good times, I find myself longin'
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface where they can't hurt us

Visa dem hur stark du är
Låt dem aldrig se dig fälla tårar
Det är så jag växte upp
Var bara en man och ta det
Allting är okej om någon frågar

Och jag kan lyfta flera tusen kilo
Och jag kan ta mig över hav och land
Kan göra nästan allt de ber om

Men jag kan inte va i samma rum som dig
Utan att jag tappar andan
Och varje gång du ser på mig
Känns som att mitt hjärta stannar
Försöker spela svår och stå emot
Men du river mina murar
Jag vet inte vad du gör
Men allting som du gör, det gör mig svag

Våga släppa taget nu
Sluta vara rädd för att bli sårad

Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear

Men han hører ikke forskjell på gresk og finans

Det er oljesøl og raggen måste gå

Nå sitter'n drita full i eget flak
Skulle aldri kjørt, skulle hatt sjåfør
Så på bunn av denne sjøen

Og jeg har handla klær, for i kveld må'n kle seg fint

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it

But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright

Jeg soner ut
Kan du bare si meg det samme som alltid?
Det er samma om du ljuger og tar det tilbake
En glorie, du får igjen

Var ingen rundt i by’n som ville være sånn som oss
Brått så skjønte vi vi måtte lære oss å sloss
Blodet rant som en foss ifra rett over øyelokket
Og arret ble til et minne om tinga vi føkker opp og sånn
Du sa du sa det til meg, antageligvis men
E’kke alltid jeg klarer å ta det te' meg
Noen ganger synеs jeg at det farligste som fins
Er allе tinga alle sier ikke fins

For tid er bare tall og vi er bare støv
Og vil du bli en engel bør du gjør' det før du dør
Jeg prøvde meg, jeg prøvde meg
Men jeg e’kke som deg

Jeg soner ut
Kan du bare si meg det samme som alltid?
Det er samma om du ljuger og tar det tilbake
En glorie, du får igjen
Så hvor er du?
Kan du bare bli med i flammene som før?
Jeg orker ikke deale med så mange tanker

Det siste jeg kan huske er at du var blitt så jævla sur
Og flaskene gikk vegg imellom til du måtte bæres ut

Men kjære deg, kjære Gud, du ville bare være kul
Jeg trodde det var kjærlighet å bare la deg være knust
Så vi var to som synes det farligste som fins
Alle tinga alle sier ikke fins

For tid er bare tall og vi er bare støv
Og vil du bli en engel bør du gjør' det før du dør
Jeg prøvde meg, jeg prøvde meg
Men jeg e’kke som deg

Så hvor er du?
Kan du ta å ringe, så drar vi et annet sted?
Trenger bare noe som ikke forandrer

Careful what you say
This time of year tends to weaken me
And have a little decency
And let me cry in peace
But there's a place where I erase
The challenges I've been through
Where I know every corner
Every street name all by heart

And so it is a part of my
Courageous plan to leave
With a broken heart
Tucked away under my sleeve

I wanna go home for Christmas
Let me go home this year
I wanna go home for Christmas
Let me go home this year

I'll pack my bags and leave
Before the sun rises tomorrow
'Cause we act more like strangers
For each day that I am here
But I have people close to me
Who never will desert me
Who remind me frequently
What I was like as a child

Or who I'll choose to love me
But I can tell you where I'm from
And who loved me to life

And so it is a part of my

Tucked away under my sleeve

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Det renner ei elv, en duvende flod gjennom livet mitt
Jeg fylles av mildhet og fred når jeg vasser i sivet ditt
Og hver gang jeg våger å bade i deg blir jeg hel og ren
Og jeg kjenner et lindrende lys gå gjennom marg og ben

Jeg lurer jo på
Hvorfor går jeg ikke mer for det?
Hvorfor, hvorfor når jeg kjenner dеt gode du gjør med meg
Dеt kan nesten virke som om jeg prøver å unngå det
Og jeg føler meg redd for nåden og gleden du skjenker meg
Forunderlig, forunderlig

Det finnes en brønn, en kilde til liv i min egen plass
Kjærlighet er navnet og blikket blir klart ved det minste glass
Og hver gang jeg våger å drikke av det blir jeg hel og ren
Og jeg kjenner et tindrende lys gå gjennom marg og ben

Jeg lurer jo på
Hvorfor går jeg ikke mer for det?
Hvorfor, hvorfor når jeg kjenner det gode du gjør med meg
Det kan nesten virke som om jeg prøver å unngå det
Og jeg føler meg redd for nåden og gleden du skjenker meg

Eg snublet omkring i svarteste natten
Da tente du stjernen med lys ifra deg
Eg følte meg ensom og tom og forlatt
Da du viste du tenkte på meg

Eg hutret og frøys da du gav meg din varme
Du så vel at jorden var naken og kald
Du lengtet til meg, og du sendte meg barnet
Og viste meg vei til en stall

Himmel på jord
En glede så stor
Eg e'kje alene
Her eg bor
Himmel på jord
En nåde så stor

Eg sloss og jeg led, gjorde alt for å vinne
Da hørte eg englene synge om fred

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Ich bin nichts ohne dich
Geld für 'n Neues hab' ich nicht

Ich will weg hier, denn jetzt dämmert mir allmählich:

Will in mein Zimmer!

Wäääääh

Ey, hab' 'ne Fehlfunktion des körpereigenen Immunsystems
Nun reagiert es überempfindlich auf Pollen, außerdem
Denkt mein Körper jetzt, ich hab' ein gesundheitliches Problem
Dabei sind's harmlose Stoffe – Pollen sind ein Phänomen
Tabletten machen müde, kann dann nicht mal mehr gerade steh'n
Das Einzige, was wirklich was bringt, ist Duschen vorm Schlafengehen
Damit die Pollen nicht im Bett oder sogar am Kissen kleben
Und trotzdem wird dir morgen Wind die Pollen in die Fresse wehen
Wenn die Nase anfängt loszulaufen und man nie
Die Tränen in den Augen wegwischen kann, irgendwie
Juckt's dich am ganzen Körper, du kriegst Ausschlag und du niest
Dann bist du wie ich, Bruder, du hast Pollenallergie!
Hab auch Allergie gegen Äpfel …
Durch Luftverschmutzung wird es noch bekräftigt
Schocktherapie und die Heilpflanzen helfen echt nicht

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

42,Lewis Capaldi - Before You Go,"103 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschBefore You Go Lyrics
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

So before you go

Would we be better off by now
If I'da let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather

Feeds the dying light

Your hands are like a flame

Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie

Hear you calling me on from afar

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Nå blir det flomvarsel her altså

Nå som fotballkarriæra mi er død
Kan jeg endelig få båten min på sjøen
Motoren gikk til helvete i Kragerø
Men alt kan repareres (Hey!)
Svir i stykker pølser på engangsgrill
Ikke mere trening, jeg tar det helt chill
Skal jeg få sommerkroppen som jeg vil
Så må jeg opereres

De har en klinikk for meg på Majorstua
De fikser meg så utrolig bra
Du kan stikke og trene noe squats
Jeg skal opereres (Hey!)

Sol, øl, smiler til kamera
Loff, smør, chillern og slapper av
Lever som aldri før
Gidder ikke trene, når jeg kan operere

Loff, smør, chillern og slapper av

And I travelled around the world
Think where you living at now?
I heard you moved to Austin
Got an apartment and settled down
And every once in a while, I start texting
Write a paragraph, but then I delete the message
Think about you like a past time
I could cry you a river, get you baptized or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study art
Love is just a tool
To remind us who we are
And that we are not alone
When we're walking in the dark
I hope someday we'll sit down together

You are everything my dreams made up

If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart, oh-oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet, bendin' like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish, never mind the bruises
Into the fire, breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got (If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger, never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter, beautiful and battered
Into the poison, cry you an ocean

You can be my guiding light
Keep me company in the night
That's all I need, all I want
Is for you to stay a little longer now
With arms around me, like a border
Like the air I breathe, I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
Cause I'm

Giving in to your touch
I can never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean

Ocean

Ocean

You can be my safety zone
Somewhere I can go when I feel alone
That's all I need, all I want
Is to stay a little longer now
Arms around me like a border
Like an endless stream
You take me in
To a place that I've never been
Now I'm

82,Alan Walker - All Falls Down,"4 ContributorsAll Falls Down Lyrics
What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been
And I know you wonder, too
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross the line and it's time to say F you
What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that

'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If it just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down

I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

Why wе fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you takе it personal (Staying cold, but you take it personal)
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope,  (Way too hard to cope)
But I still can't let you go (Can't let you go) (Go, go)

Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I've gotta learn how to love without you
I've gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sitting home without you
Fuck, I'm going out without you
I'm gonna tear this city down without you
I'm goin' Bonnie and Clyde without you

Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beating I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under56Embed"

I stripped it down for your naked eyes
So you could understand and let me inside
So I hope you know through the rising tide
That I'll be here and you can lay by my side

Oh, oh, oh
You can rely on me, you know
Oh, oh, oh
When this town is locked and closed
You can

Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me, if you’re here
You can still lay by me
(Hey-oh-yeah
Oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh-oh-oh)

I know the places you go to hide
I've been in all those rooms, I know what that's like
Staring at paint as you watch it dry (Oh-oh-oh)
But don’t forget your room is right next to mine
You might also like
And you can lay by me
If that is something you would need, yeah
Lay by me, if you need
You can

Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me if you're here
You can still lay by me
Lay by me, I still care
When you need, lay by me
Lay by me if you're here
You can still lay by me
(Hey-oh-yeah

95,Lukas Graham - 7 Years,"231 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάالعربية7 Years Lyrics
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

Now why you acting so shady lately?
You don't need to babysit me
Arigato, later dude
Gotta find another you, yeah someone new

On my way to a random bar
I'm a Columbus, 'cause he went too far
I'm a big girl baby
Don't protect me from the big world, baby

Oh, what you trying to protect me from?
I'm just 'tryna have some fun
But when we wake in the morning, stuck in a corner
Oh, just tell me why I have to stay
I don't really like to play it safe

You can't handle my outbursts, you see
Gotta let me go crazy, baby

98,JP Saxe - If The World Was Ending,"73 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisIf The World Was Ending Lyrics
I was distracted and in traffic
I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

It didn't scare me when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', the night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house and didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah, it's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

And I know, you know, we know you weren't
