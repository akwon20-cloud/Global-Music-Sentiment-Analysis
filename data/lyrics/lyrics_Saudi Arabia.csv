0,Tom Odell - Another Love,"106 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةУкраїнськаDeutschPortuguêsFrançaisЎзбекTürkçeAnother Love Lyrics
I wanna take you somewhere so you know I care
But it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils in a pretty string
But they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright
I'm just so tired to share my nights

I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up
Up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if somebody hurts you, I wanna fight
But my hand's been broken one too many times
So I'll use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words, they always win, but I know I'll lose
And I'd sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart

And I wanna cry, I wanna learn to love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

All my tears have been used up

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

(My heart is thinking of)

I wanna sing a song that'd be just ours
But I sang 'em all to another heart
And I wanna cry, I wanna fall in love
But all my tears have been used up

On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up

On another love, another love

1,Adele - Set Fire to the Rain,"87 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolBahasa MelayuFrançaisالعربيةDeutschSet Fire to the Rain Lyrics

I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years

Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

And all I am is a man

Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours

So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah

12,Saif Amer - Warqa,"1 ContributorThe Living Huitzilopochtli LyricsThey buried Doña Carlota in Sayula, and Kate, though a woman, went also to the funeral. Don Ramón followed the coffin, in his white clothes and big hat with the Quetzalcoatl sign. His boys went with him; and there were many strangers, men, in black.
The boys looked odd young shoots, in their black suits with short breeches and bare knees. They were both round-faced and creamy brown in complexion, both had a touch of fairness. The elder, Pedro, was more like Don Ramón; but his hair was softer, more fluffy than his father's, with a hint of brown. He was sulky and awkward, and kept his head ducked. The younger boy, Cyprian, had the fluffy, upstanding brown hair and the startled, hazel eyes of his mother.
They had come in a motor-car with their aunt, from Guadalajara, and were returning straight to town. In her will, the mother had named guardians in place of the father, stating that the father would consent. And her considerable fortune she had left in trust for the boys. But the father was one of the trustees.
Ramón sat in his room in the hotel, overlooking the lake, and his two boys sat on the cane settee opposite him.
'What do you want to do, my sons?' said Ramón. 'To go back with your Aunt Margarita, and return to school in the United States?'
The boys remained a while in sulky silence.
'Yes!' said Cyprian at last, his brown hair seeming to fluff up with indignation. 'That is what our mother wished us to do. So, of course, we shall do it.'
'Very well!' said Ramón quietly. 'But remember I am your father, and my door, and my arms, and my heart will always be open to you, when you come.'
The elder boy shuffled with his feet, and muttered, without looking up:
'We cannot come, papa!'
'Why not, child?'
The boy looked up at him with brown eyes as challenging as his own.
'You, papa, you call yourself The Living Quetzalcoatl?'
'Yes.'
'But, papa, our father is called Ramón Carrasco.'
'It is also true,' said Ramón, smiling.
'We,' said Pedro, rather heavily, 'are not the children of the Living Quetzalcoatl, papa. We are Carrasco y de Lara.'
'Good names both,' said Ramón.
'Never,' said the young Cyprian, his eyes flashing, 'never can we love you, papa. You are our enemy. You killed our mother.'
'No, no!' said Ramón. 'That you must not say. Your mother sought her own death.'
'Mama loved you much, much, much!' cried Cyprian, the tears rising to his eyes. 'Always she loved you and prayed for you--' He began to cry.
'And I, my son?' said Ramón.
'You hated her and killed her! Oh, mama! Mama! Oh, mama! I want my mother!' he wept.
'Come to me, little one!' said Ramón softly, holding out his hands.
'No!' cried Cyprian, stamping his foot and flashing his eyes through his tears. 'No! No!'
The elder boy hung his head and was crying too. Ramón had the little, perplexed frown of pain on his brow. He looked from side to side, as if for some issue. Then he gathered himself together.
'Listen, my sons,' he said. 'You also will be men; it will not be long. While you are little boys, you are neither men nor women. But soon, the change will come, and you will have to be men. And then you will know that a man must be a man. When his soul tells him to do a thing, he must do it. When you are men, you must listen carefully to your own souls, and be sure to be true. Be true to your own souls; there is nothing else for a man to do.'
'Je m'en fiche de ton âme, mon père!' said Cyprian, with one of his flashes into French. It was a language he often spoke with his mother.
'That you may, my boy,' said Ramón. 'But I may not.'
'Papa!' put in the elder boy. 'Is your soul different from mama's soul?'
'Who knows?' said Ramón. 'I understand it differently.'
'Because mama always prayed for your soul.'
'And I, in my way, pray for hers, child. If her soul comes back to me, I will take it into my heart.'
'Mama's soul,' said Cyprian, 'will go straight into Paradise.'
'Who knows, child! Perhaps the Paradise for the souls of the dead is the hearts of the living.'
'I don't understand what you say.'
'It is possible,' said Ramón, 'that even now the only Paradise for the soul of your mother is in my heart.'
The two boys stared at him with open eyes.
'Never will I believe that,' said Cyprian.
'Or it may be in thy heart,' said Ramón. 'Hast thou a place in thy heart for the soul of thy mother?'
The young Cyprian stared with bewildered hazel eyes.
'The soul of my mother goes direct to Paradise, because she is a saint,' he asserted flatly.
'Which Paradise, my son?'
'The only one. Where God is.'
'And where is that?'
There was a pause.
'In the sky,' said Cyprian, stubbornly.
'It is very far and very empty. But I believe, my son, that the hearts of living men are the very middle of the sky. And there God is; and Paradise; inside the hearts of living men and women. And there the souls of the dead come to rest, there, at the very centre, where the blood turns and returns; that is where the dead sleep best.'
There was a very blank pause.
'And wilt thou go on saying thou art the Living Quetzalcoatl?' said Cyprian.
'Surely! And when you are a little older, perhaps you will come to me and say it too.'
'Never! Thou hast killed our mother, and we shall hate thee. When we are men we ought to kill thee.'
'Nay, that is bombast, child! Why wilt thou listen only to servants and priests and people of that sort? Are they not thy inferiors, since thou art my son, and thy mother's son? Why dost thou take the talk of servants and inferiors into thy mouth? Hast thou no room for the speech of brave men? Thou wilt not kill me, neither will thy brother. For I would not allow you, even if you wished it. And you do not wish it. Talk no more of this empty lackey-talk to me, Cyprian, for I will not hear it. Art thou already a little lackey, or a priest? Come, thou art vulgar. Thou art a little vulgarian. We had better speak English; or thy French. Castilian is too good a language to turn into this currish talk.'
Ramón rose and went to the window to look out at the lake. The drums on the church were sounding for midday, when every man should glance at the sun, and stand silent with a little prayer.

'The sun has climbed the hill, the day is on the downward slope.
Between the morning and the afternoon, stand I here with my soul, and lift it up.
My soul is heavy with sunshine, and steeped with strength.
The sunbeams have filled me like a honeycomb,
It is the moment of fulness,
And the top of the morning.'

Ramón turned and repeated the Mid-day verse to his boys. They listened in confused silence.
'Come!' he said. 'Why are you confused? If I talked to you about your new boots, or ten pesos, you would not be confused. But if I speak of the sun and your own souls filled from the sun like honeycombs, you sulk. You had better go back to your school in America, to learn to be business men. You had better say to everybody: Oh, no! we have no father! Our mother died, but we never had a father. We are children of an immaculate conception, so we should make excellent business men.'
'I shall be a priest,' said Cyprian.
'And I a doctor,' said Pedro.
'Very good! Very good! Shall-be is far from am, and tomorrow is another day. Come to me when your heart tells you to come. You are my little boys, whatever you say, and I shall stroke your hair and laugh at you. Come! Come here!'
He looked at them, and they dared not refuse to obey, his power was so much greater than theirs.
He took his eldest son in his arms and stroked his head.
'There!' he said. 'Thou art my eldest son, and I am thy father, who calls himself The Living Quetzalcoatl. When they say: ""Is it thy father who calls himself The Living Quetzalcoatl?""--say to them: ""Yes, he is my father."" And when they ask you what you think of such a father, say: ""I am young, and I do not understand him yet. But I do not judge my father without understanding him."" Wilt thou say that, my boy, Pedro, my son?' And Ramón stroked the boy's hair with the gentleness and tenderness which filled the child with a sort of awe.
'Yes, papa! I will say that,' said the boy, relieved.
'It is well,' said Ramón, laying his hand on the child's head for a moment, like a blessing.
Then he turned to the younger son.
'Come then,' he said, 'and let me stroke thy upstanding hair.'
'If I love thee, I cannot love mama!' said Cyprian.
'Nay, is thy heart so narrow? Love not at all, if it makes thee petty.'
'But I do not want to come to thee, papa.'
'Then stay away, my son, and come when thou dost want it.'
'I do not think thou lovest me, papa.'
'Nay, when thou art an obstinate monkey, I love thee not. But when thy real manhood comes upon thee, and thou art brave and daring, rather than rash and impudent, then thou wilt be lovable. How can I love thee if thou art not lovable?'
'Mama always loved me.'
'She called thee her own. I do not call thee mine own. Thou art thyself. When thou art lovable, I can love thee. When thou art rash and impudent, nay, I cannot. The mill will not spin when the wind does not blow.'
The boys went away. Ramón watched them as they stood in their black clothes and bare knees upon the jetty, and his heart yearned over them.
'Ah, the poor little devils!' he said to himself. And then:
'But I can do no more than keep my soul like a castle for them, to be a stronghold to them when they need it--if ever they do.'
These days Kate often sat by the lake shore, in the early light of the morning. Between the rains, the day came very clear, she could see every wrinkle in the great hills opposite, and the fold, or pass, through which a river came, away at Tuliapan, was so vivid to her she felt she had walked it. The red birds looked as if rains had freshened even their poppy-buds, and in the morning frogs were whirring.
But the world was somehow different; all different. No jingle of bells from the church, no striking of the clock. The clock was taken away.
And instead, the drums. At dawn, the heavy drum rolling its sound on the air. Then the sound of the Dawn-Verse chanted from the tower, in a strong man's voice:

'The dark is dividing, the sun is coming past the wall.
Day is at hand.
Lift your hand, say Farewell! say Welcome!
Then be silent.
Let the darkness leave you, let the light come into you,
Man in the twilight.'

The voice and the great drum ceased. And in the dawn the men who had risen stood silent, with arm uplifted, in the moment of change, the women covered their faces and bent their heads. All was changeless still for the moment of change.
Then the light drum rattled swiftly, as the first sparkle of the bright sun flashed in sheer light from the crest of the great hills. The day had begun. People of the world moved on their way.
At about nine o'clock the light drum rattled quickly, and the voice in the tower cried:
'Half-way! Half-way up the slope of the morning!'
There was the heavy drum at noon, the light drum again at about three o'clock, with the cry:
'Half-way! Half-way down the slope of afternoon.'
And at sunset again, the great drum rolling, and the voice crying:

'Leave off! Leave off! Leave off!
Lift your hand, say Farewell! say Welcome!
Man in the twilight.
The sun is in the outer porch, cry to him: Thanks! Oh, Thanks!
Then be silent.
You belong to the night.'

And again in the sunset everywhere men stood with lifted faces and hands, and women covered their faces and stood with bowed heads; all was changeless still for the moment of change.
Then the lighter drums suddenly beat, and people moved on into the night.
The world was different, different. The drums seemed to leave the air soft and vulnerable, as if it were alive. Above all, no clang of metal on metal, during the moments of change.

'Metal for resistance.
Drums for the beating heart.
The heart ceases not.'

This was one of Ramón's little verses.
Strange, the change that was taking place in the world. Always the air had a softer, more velvety silence, it seemed alive. And there were no hours. Dawn and noon and sunset, mid-morning, or the up-slope middle, and mid-afternoon, or the down-slope middle, this was the day, with the watches of the night. They began to call the four watches of the day the watch of the rabbit, the watch of the hawk, the watch of the turkey-buzzard and the watch of the deer. And the four quarters of the night were the watch of the frog, the watch of the fire-fly, the watch of the fish, the watch of the squirrel.
'I shall come for you,' wrote Cipriano to her, 'when the deer is thrusting his last foot towards the forest.'
That meant, she knew, in the last quarter of the hours of the deer; something after five o'clock.
It was as if, from Ramón and Cipriano, from Jamiltepec and the lake region, a new world was unfolding, unrolling, as softly and subtly as twilight falling and removing the clutter of day. It was a soft, twilit newness slowly spreading and penetrating the world, even into the cities. Now, even in the cities the blue serapes of Quetzalcoatl were seen, and the drums were heard at the Hours, casting a strange mesh of twilight over the clash of bells and the clash of traffic. Even in the capital the big drum rolled again, and men, even men in city clothes, would stand still with uplifted faces and arm upstretched, listening for the noon-verse, which they knew in their hearts, and trying not to hear the clash of metal.

'Metal for resistance.
Drums for the beating heart.'

But it was a world of metal, and a world of resistance. Cipriano, strangely powerful with the soldiers, in spite of the hatred he aroused in other officials, was for meeting metal with metal. For getting Montes to declare: The Religion of Quetzalcoatl is the religion of Mexico, official and declared.--Then backing up the declaration with the army.
But no! no! said Ramón. Let it spread of itself. And wait awhile, till you can be declared the living Huitzilopochtli, and your men can have the red and black blanket, with the snake-curve. Then perhaps we can have the open wedding with Caterina, and she will be a mother among the gods.
All the time, Ramón tried as far as possible to avoid arousing resistance and hate. He wrote open letters to the clergy, saying:
'Who am I, that I should be enemy of the One Church? I am catholic of catholics. I would have One Church of all the world, with Rome for the Central City, if Rome wish.
'But different peoples must have different Saviours, as they have different speech and different colour. The final mystery is one mystery. But the manifestations are many.
'God must come to Mexico in a blanket and in huaraches, else He is no God of the Mexicans, they cannot know Him. Naked, all men are but men. But the touch, the look, the word that goes from one naked man to another is the mystery of living. We live by manifestations.
'And men are fragile, and fragments, and strangely grouped in their fragmentariness. The invisible God has done it to us, darkened some faces and whitened others, and grouped us in groups, even as the zopilote is a bird, and the parrot of the hot lands is a bird, and the little oriole is a bird. But the angel of the zopilotes must be a zopilote, and the angel of the parrots a parrot. And to one, the dead carcase will ever smell good; to the other, the fruit.
'Priests who will come to me do not forsake either faith or God. They change their manner of speech and vestments, as the peon calls with one cry to the oxen, and with another cry to the mules. Each responds to its own call in its own way--'
To the socialists and agitators he wrote:
'What do you want? Would you make all men as you are? And when every peon in Mexico wears an American suit of clothes and shiny black shoes, and looks for life in the newspaper and for his manhood to the government, will you be satisfied? Did the government, then, give you your manhood, that you expect it to give it to these others?
'It is time to forget. It is time to put away the grudge and the pity. No man was ever the better for being pitied, and every man is the worse for a grudge.
'We can do nothing with life, except live it.
'Let us seek life where it is to be found. And, having found it, life will solve the problems. But every time we deny the living life, in order to solve a problem, we cause ten problems to spring up where was one before. Solving the problems of the people, we lose the people in a poisonous forest of problems.
'Life makes, and moulds, and changes the problem. The problem will always be there, and will always be different. So nothing can be solved, even by life and living, for life dissolves and resolves, solving it leaves alone.
'Therefore we turn to life; and from the clock to the sun and from metal to membrane.
'This way we hope the problem will dissolve, since it can never be solved. When men seek life first, they will not seek land nor gold. The land will lie on the lap of the gods, where men lie. And if the old communal system comes back, and the village and the land are one, it will be very good. For truly, no man can possess lands.
'But when we are deep in a bog, it is no use attempting to gallop. We can only wade out with toil. And in our haste to have a child, it is no good tearing the babe from the womb.
'Seek life, and life will bring the change.
'Seek life itself, even pause at dawn and at sunset, and life will come back into us and prompt us through the transitions.
'Lay forcible hands on nothing, only be ready to resist, if forcible hands should be laid on you. For the new shoots of life are tender, and better ten deaths than that they should be torn or trampled down by the bullies of the world. When it comes to fighting for the tender shoots of life, fight as the jaguar fights for her young, as the she-bear for her cubs.
'That which is life is vulnerable, only metal is invulnerable. Fight for the vulnerable unfolding of life. But for that, fight never to yield.'
Cipriano, too, was always speaking to his soldiers, always with the same cry:
'We are men! We are fighters!
'But what can we do?
'Shall we march to simple death?
'No! No! We must march to life.
'The gringos are here. We have let them come. We must let them stay, for we cannot drive them out. With guns and swords and bayonets we can never drive them out, for they have a thousand where we have one. And if they come in peace, let them stay in peace.
'But we have not lost Mexico yet. We have not lost each other.
'We are the blood of America. We are the blood of Montezuma.
'What is my hand for? Is it to turn the handle of a machine alone?
'My hand is to salute the God of Mexicans, beyond the sky.
'My hand is to touch the hand of a brave man.
'My hand is to hold a gun.
'My hand is to make the corn grow out of the ground.
'What are my knees for?
'My knees are to hold me proud and erect.
'My knees are for marching on my way.
'My knees are the knees of a man.
'Our god is Quetzalcoatl of the blue sky, and Huitzilopochtli red at the gates, watching.
'Our gods hate a kneeling man. They shout Ho! Erect!
'Then what can we do?
'Wait!
'I am a man, naked inside my clothes as you are.
'Am I a big man? Am I a tall and powerful man, from Tlascala, for example.
'I am not. I am little. I am from the south. I am small--
'Yet am I not your general?
'Why?
'Why am I a general, and you only soldiers?
'I will tell you.
'I found the other strength.
'There are two strengths; the strength which is the strength of oxen and mules and iron, of machines and guns, and of men who cannot get the second strength.
'Then there is the second strength. It is the strength you want. And you can get it, whether you are small or big. It is the strength that comes from behind the sun. And you can get it; you can get it here!'--he struck his breast--'and here!'--he struck his belly--'and here!'--he struck his loins. 'The strength that comes from back of the sun.'
When Cipriano was roused, his eyes flashed, and it was as if dark feathers, like pinions, were starting out of him, out of his shoulders and back, as if these dark pinions clashed and flashed like a roused eagle. His men seemed to see him, as by second sight, with the demonish clashing and dashing of wings, like an old god. And they murmured, their eyes flashing:
'It is Cipriano! It is he! We are Ciprianistos, we are his children.'
'We are men! We are men!' cried Cipriano.
'But listen. There are two kinds of men. There are men with the second strength, and men without it.
'When the first gringos came, we lost our second strength. And the padres taught us: Submit! Submit!
'The gringos had got the second strength!
'How?
'Like cunning ones, they stole it on the sly. They kept very still, like a tarantula in his hole. Then when neither sun nor moon nor stars knew he was there, Biff!--the tarantula sprang across, and bit, and left the poison and sucked the secret.
'So they got the secrets of the air and the water, and they got the secrets out of the earth. So the metals were theirs, and they made guns and machines and ships, and they made trains and telegrams and radio.
'Why? Why did they make all these things? How could they do it?
'Because, by cunning, they had got the secret of the second strength, which comes from behind the sun.
'And we had to be slaves, because we had only got the first strength, we had lost the second strength.
'Now we are getting it back. We have found our way again to the secret sun behind the sun. There sat Quetzalcoatl, and at last Don Ramón found him. There sits the red Huitzilopochtli, and I have found him. For I have found the second strength.
'When he comes, all you who strive shall find the second strength.
'And when you have it, where will you feel it?
'Not here!'--and he struck his forehead. 'Not where the cunning gringos have it, in the head, and in their books. Not we. We are men, we are not spiders.
'We shall have it here!'--he struck his breast--'and here!'--he struck his belly--'and here!'--he struck his loins.
'Are we men? Can we not get the second strength? Can we not? Have we lost it forever?
'I say no! Quetzalcoatl is among us. I have found the red Huitzilopochtli. The second strength!
'When you walk or sit, when you work or lie down, when you eat or sleep, think of the second strength, that you must have it.
'Be very quiet. It is shy as a bird in a dark tree.
'Be very clean, clean in your bodies and your clothes. It is like a star, that will not shine in dirt.
'Be very brave, and do not drink till you are drunk, nor soil yourself with bad women, nor steal. Because a drunken man has lost his second strength, and a man loses his strength in bad women, and a thief is a coward, and the red Huitzilopochtli hates a coward.
'Try! Try for the second strength. When we have it, the others will lose it.'
Cipriano struggled hard with his army. The curse of any army is the having nothing to do. Cipriano made all his men cook and wash for themselves, clean and paint the barracks, make a great garden to grow vegetables, and plant trees wherever there was water. And he himself took a passionate interest in what they did. A dirty tunic, a sore foot, a badly-made huarache did not escape him. But even when they cooked their meals he went among them.
'Give me something to eat,' he would say. 'Give me an enchilada!'
Then he praised the cooking, or said it was bad.
Like all savages, they liked doing small things. And, like most Mexicans, once they were a little sure of what they were doing, they loved doing it well.
Cipriano was determined to get some discipline into them. Discipline is what Mexico needs, and what the whole world needs. But it is the discipline from the inside that matters. The machine discipline, from the outside, breaks down.
He had the wild Indians from the north beat their drums in the barrack-yard, and start the old dances again. The dance, the dance which has meaning, is a deep discipline in itself. The old Indians of the north still have the secret of animistic dancing. They dance to gain power; power over the living forces or potencies of the earth. And these dances need intense dark concentration, and immense endurance.
Cipriano encouraged the dances more than anything. He learned them himself, with curious passion. The shield and spear dance, the knife dance, the dance of ambush, and the surprise dance, he learned them in the savage villages of the north, and he danced them in the barrack-yard, by the bonfire, at night, when the great doors were shut.
Then, naked saved for a black breech-cloth, his body smeared with oil and red earth-powder, he would face some heavy naked Indian and with shield and spear dance the dance of the two warriors, champions in the midst of the dense ring of soldiers. And the silent, rhythmic concentration of this duel in subtlety and rapidity kept the feet softly beating with the drum, the naked body suave and subtle, circling with suave, primitive stealth, then crouching and leaping like a panther, with the spear poised, to a clash of shields, parting again with the crowing yell of defiance and exultance.
In this dance, no one was more suave and sudden than Cipriano. He could swerve along the ground with bent, naked back, as invisible as a lynx, circling round his opponent, his feet beating and his suave body subtly lilting to the drum. Then in a flash he was in the air, his spear pointing down at the collarbone of his enemy and gliding over his shoulder, as the opponent swerved under, and the war-yell resounded. The soldiers in the deep circle watched, fascinated, uttering the old low cries.
And as the dance went on, Cipriano felt his strength increase and surge inside him. When all his limbs were glistening with sweat, and his spirit was at last satisfied, he was at once tired and surcharged with extraordinary power. Then he would throw his scarlet and dark serape around him, and motion other men to fight, giving his spear and shield to another officer or soldier, going himself to sit down on the ground and watch, by the firelight. And then he felt his limbs and his whole body immense with power, he felt the black mystery of power go out of him over all his soldiers. And he sat there imperturbable, in silence, holding all those black-eyed men in the splendour of his own, silent self. His own dark consciousness seemed to radiate through their flesh and their bones; they were conscious, not through themselves but through him. And as a man's instinct is to shield his own head, so that instinct was to shield Cipriano, for he was the most precious part of themselves to them. It was in him they were supreme. They got their splendour from his power and their greatest consciousness was his consciousness diffusing them.
'I am not of myself,' he would say to them. 'I am of the red Huitzilopochtli and the power from behind the sun. And you are not of yourselves. Of yourselves you are nothing. You are of me, my men.'
He encouraged them to dance naked, with the breech-cloth, to rub themselves with the red earth-powder, over the oil.
'This is the oil of the stars. Rub it well into your limbs and you will be strong as the starry sky. This is the red blood of volcanoes. Rub yourselves with it, you will have the power of the fire of the volcanoes, from the centre of the earth.'
He encouraged them to dance the silent, concentrated dances to the drum, to dance for hours, gathering power and strength.
'If you know how to tread the dance, you can tread deeper and deeper, till you touch the middle of the earth with your foot. And when you touch the middle of the earth, you will have such power in your belly and your breast, no man will be able to overcome you. Get the second strength. Get it, get it out of the earth, get it from behind the sun. Get the second strength.'
He made long, rapid marches across the wild Mexican country, and through the mountains, moving light and swift. He liked to have his men camping in the open, with no tents: but the watch set, and the stars overhead. He pursued the bandits with swift movements. He stripped his captives, and tied them up. But if it seemed a brave man, he would swear him in. If it seemed to him a knave, a treacherous cur, he stabbed him to the heart, saying:
'I am the red Huitzilopochtli, of the knife.'
Already he had got his own small, picked body of men out of the ignominious drab uniform, dressed in white with the scarlet sash and the scarlet ankle cords, and carrying the good, red and black serape. And his men must be clean. On the march they would stop by some river, with the order for every man to strip and wash, and wash his clothing. Then the men, dark and ruddy, moved about naked, while the white clothing of strong white cotton dried on the earth. They moved on again, glittering with the peculiar whiteness of cotton clothes in Mexico, gun at their backs, serape and small pack on their backs, wearing the heavy straw hats with the scarlet crowns on their heads.
'They must move!' he said to his officers. 'They must learn again to move swiftly and untiringly, with the old power. They must not lie about. In the sleep hours, let them sleep. In the waking, let them work, or march, or drill, or dance.'
He divided his regiment up into little companies of a hundred each, with a centurion and a sergeant in command. Each company of a hundred must learn to act in perfect unison, freely and flexibly. 'Perfect your hundred,' Cipriano insisted, 'and I will perfect your thousands and your tens of thousands.'
'Listen!' he said. 'For us, no trench and cannon warfare. My men are no cannon-fodder, nor trench-dung. Where cannon are, we move away. Our hundreds break up, and we attack where the cannon are not. That we are swift, that we are silent, that we have no burdens, and that the second strength is in us: that is all. We intend to put up no battle-front, but to attack at our own moment, and at a thousand points.'
And always he reiterated:
'If you can get the power from the heart of the earth, and the power from behind the sun; if you can summon the power of the red Huitzilopochtli into you, nobody can conquer you. Get the second strength.'
Ramón was pressing Cipriano now openly to assume the living Huitzilopochtli.
'Come!' he said. 'It is time you let General Viedma be swallowed up in the red Huitzilopochtli. Don't you think?'
'If I know what it means,' said Cipriano.
They were sitting on the mats in Ramón's room, in the heat before the rain came, towards the end of the rainy season.
'Stand up!' said Ramón.
Cipriano stood up at once, with that soft, startling alertness in his movement.
Ramón came quickly to him, placed one of his hands over Cipriano's eyes, closing them. Ramón stood behind Cipriano, who remained motionless in the warm dark, his consciousness reeling in strange concentric waves, towards a centre where it suddenly plunges into the bottomless deeps, like sleep.
'Cipriano?'--the voice sounded so far off.
'Yes.'
'Is it dark?'
'It is dark.'
'Is it alive? Is the darkness alive?'
'Surely it is alive.'
'Who lives?'
'I.'
'Where?'
'I know not. In the living darkness.'
Ramón then bound Cipriano's eyes and head with a strip of black fur. Then again, with a warm, soft pressure, he pressed one naked hand over Cipriano's naked breast, and one between his shoulders. Cipriano stood in profound darkness, erect and silent.
'Cipriano?'
'Yes.'
'Is it dark in your heart?'
'It is coming dark.'
Ramón felt the thud of the man's heart slowly slackening. In Cipriano, another circle of darkness had started slowly to revolve, from his heart. It swung in widening rounds, like a greater sleep.
'Is it dark?'
'It is dark.'
'Who lives?'
'I.'
Ramón bound Cipriano's arms at his sides, with a belt of fur round the breast. Then he put his one hand over the navel, his other hand in the small of the other man's back, pressing with slow, warm, powerful pressure.
'Cipriano?'
'Yes.'
The voice and the answer going farther and farther away.
'Is it dark?'
'No, my Lord.'
Ramón knelt and pressed his arms close round Cipriano's waist, pressing his black head against his side. And Cipriano began to feel as if his mind, his head were melting away in the darkness; like a pearl in black wine, the other circle of sleep began to swing, vast. And he was a man without a head, moving like a dark wind over the face of the dark waters.
'Is it perfect?'
'It is perfect.'
'Who lives?'
'Who--!'
Cipriano no longer knew.
Ramón bound him fast round the middle, then, pressing his head against the hip, folded the arms round Cipriano's loins, closing with his hands the secret places.
'Cipriano?'
'Yes.'
'Is it all dark?'
But Cipriano could not answer. The last circle was sweeping round, and the breath upon the waters was sinking into the waters, there was no more utterance. Ramón kneeled with pressed head and arms and hands, for some moments still. Then he bound the loins, binding the wrists to the hips.
Cipriano stood rigid and motionless. Ramón clasped the two knees with his hands, till they were warm, and he felt them dark and asleep like two living stones, or two eggs. Then swiftly he bound them together, and grasped the ankles, as one might grasp the base of a young tree, as it emerges from the earth. Crouching on the earth, he gripped them in an intense grip, resting his head on the feet. The moments passed, and both men were unconscious.
Then Ramón bound the ankles, lifted Cipriano suddenly, with a sleep-moving softness, laid him on the skin of a big mountain-lion, which was spread upon the blankets, threw over him the red and black serape of Huitzilopochtli, and lay down at his feet, holding Cipriano's feet to his own abdomen.
And both men passed into perfect unconsciousness, Cipriano within the womb of undisturbed creation, Ramón in the death sleep.
How long they were both dark, they never knew. It was twilight. Ramón was suddenly aroused by the jerking of Cipriano's feet. He sat up, and took the blanket off Cipriano's face.
'Is it night?' said Cipriano.
'Almost night,' said Ramón.
Silence followed, while Ramón unfastened the bonds, beginning at the feet. Before he unbound the eyes, he closed the window, so the room was almost dark. Then he unfastened the last binding, and Cipriano sat up, looking, then suddenly covering his eyes.
'Make it quite dark!' he said.
Ramón closed the shutters, and the room was complete night. Then he returned and sat on the mat by Cipriano. Cipriano was asleep again. After a while, Ramón left him.
He did not see him again till dawn. Then Ramón found him going down to the lake, to swim. The two men swam together, while the sun rose. With the rain, the lake was colder. They went to the house to rub oil in their limbs.
Cipriano looked at Ramón with black eyes which seemed to be looking at all space.
'I went far,' he said.
'To where there is no beyond?' said Ramón.
'Yes, there.'
And in a moment or two, Cipriano was wrapped in his blanket again, and asleep.
He did not wake till the afternoon. Then he ate, and took a boat, and rowed down the lake to Kate. He found her at home. She was surprised to see him, in his white clothes and with his serape of Huitzilopochtli.
'I am going to be the living Huitzilopochtli,' he said.
'Are you? When? Does it feel queer?'--Kate was afraid of his eyes; they seemed inhuman.
'On Thursday. The day of Huitzilopochtli is to be Thursday. Won't you sit beside me, and be wife of me when I am a god?'
'But do you feel you are a god?' she asked, querulous.
He turned his eyes on her strangely.
'I have been,' he said. 'And I have come back. But I belong there, where I went.'
'Where?'
'Where there is no beyond, and the darkness sinks into the water, and waking and sleeping are one thing.'
'No,' said Kate, afraid. 'I never understood mystical things. They make me uneasy.'
'Is it mystical when I come in to you?'
'No,' said Kate. 'Surely, that is physical.'
'So is the other, only further. Won't you be the bride of Huitzilopochtli?' he asked again.
'Not so soon,' said Kate.
'Not so soon!' he re-echoed.
There was a pause.
'Will you come back with me to Jamiltepec now?' he asked.
'Not now,' she said.
'Why not now?'
'Oh, I don't know.--You treat me as if I had no life of my own,' she said. 'But I have.'
'A life of your own? Who gave it you? Where did you get it?'
'I don't know. But I have got it. And I must live it. I can't be just swallowed up.'
'Why, Malintzi?' he said, giving her a name. 'Why can't you?'
'Be just swallowed up?' she said. 'Well, I just can't.'
'I am the living Huitzilopochtli,' he said. 'And I am swallowed up. I thought, so could you be, Malintzi.'
'No! Not quite!' she said.
'Not quite! Not quite! Not now! Not just now! How often you say Not, to-day!--I must go back to Ramón.'
'Yes. Go back to him. You only care about him, and your living Quetzalcoatl and your living Huitzilopochtli.--I am only a woman.'
'No, Malintzi, you are more. You are more than Kate, you are Malintzi.'
'I am not! I am only Kate, and I am only a woman. I mistrust all that other stuff.'
'I am more than just a man, Malintzi.--Don't you see that?'
'No!' said Kate. 'I don't see it. Why should you be more than just a man?'
'Because I am the living Huitzilopochtli. Didn't I tell you? You've got dust in your mouth to-day, Malintzi.'
He went away, leaving her rocking in anger on her terrace, in love again with her old self, and hostile to the new thing. She was thinking of London and Paris and New York, and all the people there.
'Oh!' she cried to herself, stifling. 'For heaven's sake let me get out of this, and back to simple human people. I loathe the very sound of Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli. I would die rather than be mixed up in it any more. Horrible, really, both Ramón and Cipriano. And they want to put it over me, with their high-flown bunk, and their Malintzi. Malintzi! I am Kate Forrester, really. I am neither Kate Leslie nor Kate Tylor. I am sick of these men putting names over me. I was born Kate Forrester, and I shall die Kate Forrester. I want to go home. Loathsome, really, to be called Malintzi.--I've had it put over me.'Embed"

This night is cold in the kingdom

From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly

I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you

With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
And when you look at me like that, my darlin'

I'd probably still adore you
With your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought
That I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though
It's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure
Such a perfect place to start

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)409Embed"

Put your lovin' hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Oh, the wind whistles down the cold, dark street tonight
And the people, they were dancin' to the music vibe
And the boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the shy, tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs, they get louder, each one better than before

And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
And you're singin' the songs, thinkin' this is the life
And you wake up in the mornin', and your head feels twice the size
Where you gonna go, where you gonna go?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?
Where you gonna sleep tonight?

So you're headin' down the road in your taxi for four
And you're waitin' outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in, and nobody's home till four
So you're sittin' there with nothin' to do
Talkin' about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go, and where you gonna sleep tonight

Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die (oo-oh)

They never lose hope when everything's cold
And the fighting's near
It's deep in their bonesThey run into smoke when the fire is fierce
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die
Legends never die...

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs – the scars collected all their lives (oo-oh)
When everything's lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream

I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low

Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo! (Ooh, ooh)

Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?
Guess who's back? Guess who's back?

(Da-da-da, da, da, da, da)

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me

كيف الأوساخ وسخ فبالوسخة أنا كيفتك
والحبر لو نضف بتنح إنت ولون فصيلتك
الصمت كبرياء بس الكلام لغة أشكالكوا
فيبخ قلمي زفت عشان أبقى سيد مقامكوا
باصم في قلمكوا وفي فلوهاتكوا
فلو الأولد تقل أظن واضج مين أتقلكوا
بشوف بنشاتكوا، مقاس عبطكوا
فأنزل بالبنش أدق تتش، جديدي بيعيطكوا
عمري ما أسمعكوا ولا أقبل التكنيك بتاعكوا
‫بديك تكنيك في Beat، عارف يا شقيق منين أوجعكوا
كل ما أجمعكوا في تراك أدمعكوا
‫عيني في عينك، عينك من إني Support وهنفعكوا
(تعرف يلا)
(رأي الجمهور يا لولو إن ڤيوهاتي بتجمعكوا)
الأولد سكول ململم، بارات ريحتها شعبي
مش هتصنف كأول عشان أقرف تيجوا بعدي
فأنا لوحدي، كفة بأسلوبي ومساحتي
وإبقي قبلي سمسم يا لولو لو فلحتي
‫بستكبر ع الـ MC's وسط تعليم مجاني
ضعيف ينافس أضعف، أهزم نزار قباني
أجلي مش هجلي، هعلم ع المتنبي
الأعمى شاف سطوره وأنا العمي إتلموا جنبي
أبياته قتلته، باراتي حرقتكوا
سايب قصور الشعر، جاي أسيب علامة في بيتكوا
الجوكر فوق الكل زل بس فل
غلطة، شرطة إكتب فوقيها (كيدهم)
شوق العبد كرسي سيده
أشق بار ببنشي أجيبه
هدفهم أقل مش يزيدوا
حلم الكلب عضمة مش في إيده
برضه مش هيجيبوا، نصايحي مش هتفيده
نقل الدم مش هيحي حد الضعف صاب وريده (فانكش)
وسيبوا مهما تسيبوا، سيبها للأيام تجيبه
عارف إن طول لسانه عشان يدراي قصر إيده
وعيدوا مهما تعيدوا، في التراك حاولوا تقليده
مش عيب ع اللي قلمي ساعده لما دخلت فيتو
فتحت إيدي صانعة وتحت السلعة قرعة
‫أتقل MC's تشوفهم دول واخدين باراتي راضعة
فالجسة خاضعة لسيوف وأقلام لمعتها ساطعة
في الراب يجمعنا بيف، في الدنيا سيب تجمعنا قاطعة
‫صراحة ماستنضفش، لا ده Flow ولا ده شخص
لو كان الراب دراع بالإجماع ماستحرمش
فوق ومابيخسرش، الأولد مابيقفش
الكيك تحت رجلي، داقق كل سنير ببنش
بسيب زبون الكيف بكيفه والتراكات دي أوفر
وسيب البيت في بيته، لو مش راكب ركب جوكر
وسجل سابقة، خاطفة سارقة
الفن من تحتك لتحت رجل حد أبقى
وسيبني أنقى بعيد عن كل خرئة
فكر إنه ذئب بس هو نمرة فاشلة
فالدودة تحرق حودة، الإيد قصيرة، أفعاله محدودة
تلف تلف في عيبه يتف، وش لوش عينه مكسورة
فأدي السلاح بسلاح، سماح مفيش سماح
واللي مش قد قوله مكانش دورة عمل سفاح، برزع
فالغرزة كانت ميعادنا
من غير سلاح قعدنا
واللي ليه شوق لو قد شوقه كان نزل زعلنا
فكرني أسيبه، إرمي السلاح اللي بتهيبه
دي مرات الأسد تتعرف من الواد اللي بتجيبه
والدنيا ضيقة، دوارة بتلف، شوف بقى
مني فين هتستخبى، عيال إيديها رقيقة
مكالمة مسجلنها، إجمالاً كاسر عينها
نمسي على الشباب وعلى المربعة اللي منها
واللي فيه قلب كان قلب بس القلم قلاب
والسب كان بسبب رقة خفت قلب الشباب
فلفت لفت، لو حدفت العين علينا تهاب
حذفت إنك إتكسفت يا كاتش خطة راجل كداب
فكسر كسر عبد يكسر أسر يوم أسير
لا على جثة سيدك سيبك مش هتركب السبق
فركب الرجولة تاكسي روح جوكر جه
إركبني لو عرفت تقولها ياض يا ألدغ في الره
فأدي الزباين كتروا وفي الأخر بيجروا
بيني وبينك كاسر عينك، يشهد سور المترو
فسيب ما أسيب، سيب سوقيتها للي يعدي بيها
ويجيب من بوق الديب اللقمة لو كات عينه فيها
بطلوا ده وإسمعوا ده ، يابا مسي
نفسي تقدرها إن كبيرها أكبر فانزي
شلة ما بتعرفش، في وشي ما بتقفش
ستوب مين يا حيلتها، التوب فوق وما بيتصابش
ضرب مين ما ضربش، الجوكر مبيخسرش
واللي جيت لإسمه إسمه في ضهره ما بيذكرش
ألف الچوب هوب تاخد إنت وچوبي صورة
باراتي وإستفاتي عالية عليك، عينيك مكسورة
الأولد معلمهولك، باهت فوق إسلوبك
الخبرة عبرة في كل تراك جديد بسمعهولك
بانش حيلتها، عادي في بيتها
سمعتك إطمنت إن تراكاتي سابت بصمتها
فوق الخط شد سطر، نلعب فوق البيف
شغل النط فوق الكتف، لا فوق يا شقيق
واللي رشق نشأ من تحت إيدي، إسال حنون
ده كوبي وبيست، تيست نون النسوة في الملعون
باسوا إيد ورجل عشان أفضي شبر
حلم القطة تبقي شبل، حلم مشمشم يبقى نمر
بقر يلف الساقية تبن، الأصلي أصلي ياض يا إستبن
فوق العرش وسط جزيرتي، بيني وبينكوا بحر حبر
جو ده دق دق على الكروان ساعة ما زق زق
لولو هأهأ، فرق واضح داهية تاخدك
فأنا بخرق، سين وصاد بيهم فشختك
آه ده لا لا، برا برا راكبها قبلك
بقولك لو الزبون نضيف غلف وإبعتله في تراكاتي
لو ودنه كسر سيبه يسمع في تراكات الباقي
وأنا اللي باقي، فوق وفوقي مش هتلاقي
باكل وأكل فتشوف العز بان في عيالي
حتى اللي قالك ركز لو ركز يموت
في بحر الألف به ما جه غير جوكر إخطبوط
برضه البيتات ساوند كليك تشيك يا حيلتها
‫ميزيتها، لو على البنشات MC's زعلت في بيتها

Джинсики низко, моя походка G.O.A.T (G.O.A.T)
Ты копируешь меня, но ты лох (лох)
Ее мечта - это побывать на мне
Моя мечта - не заблудиться во тьме
Ты будешь двигаться, так как хочет choppa
Ты приходишь для общения со мной, двигай жопой
Ваша цена максимум - пакет из цума (Цума)
Ты продашь очко, если будет очень много шума
Вы базарите за деньги, вы тупые идиоты
Отдадите семью за ебанные банкноты
Серьезно, вы же черствые ебанаты
Которыми будут двигать прямо в такты (Правда)
У меня есть все: деньги, тачки и моя банда
Но нет настоящей любви, это правда
Я люблю свою родню, за них отдам все, что есть
Убиваете себя, для меня это жесть
Я читаю true, это big факты
Я буду рвать, это характер
Шмотки мэйсон марджуха
Прыгай на моем хуе, ты же шлюха (Ты же шлюха, я-я)
Drug’и помогают мне быть всегда веселым
Наркоту мешаю с алкоголем (Прямо с алкоголем)
Засыпаю и надеюсь, что не умру
Не верю в бога, надеюсь, не буду в аду
Я миксую дранк и опиат, нету в нике 4n way
Я живу, как я хочу - это my wave
21november, но не savage - это мой name
Как тебя не обижать, ты же лейм (Лейм)
У меня есть rick’и, dior и fame (Fame)
Ты пиздишь на друга, хоть ты сам same (Same)
Я люблю oneheart snowfall, но и rain
Мне разбили сердце, это мой pain

يمكن حبيتي وروحتي وجيتي واتنسيتي مع الأيام

وأنا لو على قلبي فحن عشانك فجأة ومال
وأنا مهما يقولوا بشوفك غير كل اللي اتقال
تسحرني عيونك لو قابلوني وأقول يا سلام
كان فين من بدري وجودك جمبي يا أحلى ملاك؟

وقالوا عليكي إن إنتي عينيكي قاسية ومفيش فيها مكان

Look out for yourself

I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement

He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed
But keep on praying

A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?

Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin

Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)

75,Fawaz Ben Awad - Shalaa Balahon,"2 Contributors”Exterminate all the Brutes”: Gaza 2009 * LyricsOn Saturday December 27, 2008, the latest US-Israeli attack on helpless Palestinians was launched. The attack had been meticulously planned, for over 6 months according to the Israeli press. The planning had two components: military and propaganda. It was based on the lessons of Israel's 2006 invasion of Lebanon, which was considered to be poorly planned and badly advertised. We may, therefore, be fairly confident that most of what has been done and said was pre-planned and intended.
That surely includes the timing of the assault: shortly before noon, when children were returning from school and crowds were milling in the streets of densely populated Gaza City. It took only a few minutes to kill over 200 people and wound 700, an auspicious opening to the mass slaughter of defenseless civilians trapped in a tiny cage with nowhere to flee.1
The attack specifically targeted the closing ceremony of a police academy, killing dozens of policemen. The international law division of the Israeli army (IDF, Israeli Defense Forces) had criticized the plans for months, but under army pressure, its director, Col. Pnina Sharvit-Baruch, gave the department's approval. ""Also under pressure,"" Ha'aretz reports, ""Sharvit-Baruch and the division also legitimized the attack on Hamas government buildings and the relaxing of the rules of engagement, resulting in numerous Palestinian casualties."" The international law division adopts ""permissive positions"" so as ""to remain relevant and influential,"" the article continues. Sharvit-Baruch then joined the Law Faculty at Tel Aviv University, over protests by the director of the university's human rights center and other faculty.
The legal division's decision was based on the army's categorization of the police ""as a resistance force in the event of an Israeli incursion into the Gaza Strip,"" Hebrew University Law professor Yuval Shany observed, adding that the principle scarcely ""differentiates them from  reservists or even from 16-year-olds who will be drafted in two years"" - hence takes much of Israel's population to be legitimate targets of terror. To take a different analogy, the IDF rules of engagement justify the terrorist attack on police cadets in Lahore in March 2009, killing at least 8, rightly condemned as ""barbaric""; Pakistani elite forces could, however, respond in this case, killing or capturing the terrorists, an option not available to Gazans. The narrow scope of the IDF concept of ""protected civilian"" is explained further by a senior figure in its international law division: ""The people who go into a house despite a warning do not have to be taken into account in terms of injury to civilians, because they are voluntary human shields. From the legal point of view, I do not have to show consideration for them. In the case of people who return to their home in order to protect it, they are taking part in the fighting.""2
In his retrospective analysis entitled ""Parsing Gains of Gaza War,"" New York Times correspondent Ethan Bronner cited the first day's achievement as one of the most significant of the war's gains. Israel calculated that it would be advantageous to appear to ""go crazy,"" causing vastly disproportionate terror, a doctrine that traces back to the 1950s. ""The Palestinians in Gaza got the message on the first day,"" Bronner wrote, ""when Israeli warplanes struck numerous targets simultaneously in the middle of a Saturday morning. Some 200 were killed instantly, shocking Hamas and indeed all of Gaza."" The tactic of ""going crazy"" appears to have been successful, Bronner concluded: there are ""limited indications that the people of Gaza felt such pain from this war that they will seek to rein in Hamas,"" the elected government. Inflicting pain on civilians for political ends is another long-standing doctrine of state terror, in fact its guiding principle. I do not, incidentally, recall the Times retrospective ""Parsing Gains of Chechnya War,"" though the gains were great.3
The meticulous planning also presumably included the termination of the assault. It ended just before the inauguration, thus minimizing the (remote) threat that President Obama might have to say some words critical of these vicious US-supported crimes.
Two weeks after the Sabbath opening of the assault, with much of Gaza already pounded to rubble and the death toll approaching 1000, the UN Agency UNRWA, on which most Gazans depend for survival, announced that the Israeli military refused to allow aid shipments to Gaza, saying that the crossings were closed for the Sabbath.4 To honor the holy day, Palestinians at the edge of survival must be denied food and medicine, while hundreds can be slaughtered on the Sabbath by US jet bombers and helicopters.
The rigorous observance of the Sabbath in this dual fashion attracted little if any notice. That makes sense. In the annals of US-Israeli criminality, such cruelty and cynicism scarcely merit more than a footnote. They are too familiar. To cite one relevant parallel, in June 1982 the US-backed Israeli invasion of Lebanon opened with the bombing of the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, later to become famous as the site of terrible massacres supervised by the IDF. The bombing hit the local hospital - the Gaza hospital -- and killed over 200 people, according to the eyewitness account of an American Middle East academic specialist. The massacre was the opening act in an invasion that slaughtered some 15-20,000 people and destroyed much of southern Lebanon and Beirut, proceeding with crucial US military and diplomatic support. That included vetoes of Security Council resolutions seeking to halt the criminal aggression that was undertaken, as scarcely concealed, to defend Israel from the threat of peaceful political settlement, contrary to useful fabrications about Israelis suffering under intense rocketing, a fantasy of apologists.5
All of this is normal, and quite frankly discussed by high Israeli officials. Thirty years ago Chief of Staff Mordechai Gur observed that since 1948, ""we have been fighting against a population that lives in villages and cities."" As Israel's most prominent military analyst, Zeev Schiff, summarized his remarks, ""the Israeli Army has always struck civilian populations, purposely and consciously...the Army, he said, has never distinguished civilian  targets... purposely attacked civilian targets."" The reasons were explained by the distinguished statesman Abba Eban: ""there was a rational prospect, ultimately fulfilled, that affected populations would exert pressure for the cessation of hostilities."" The effect, as Eban well understood, would be to allow Israel to implement, undisturbed, its programs of illegal expansion and harsh repression. Eban was commenting on a review of Labor government attacks against civilians by Prime Minister Begin, presenting a picture, Eban said, ""of an Israel wantonly inflicting every possible measure of death and anguish on civilian populations in a mood reminiscent of regimes which neither Mr.Begin nor I would dare to mention by name."" Eban did not contest the facts that Begin reviewed, but criticized him for stating them publicly. Nor did it concern Eban, or his admirers, that his advocacy of massive state terror is also reminiscent of regimes he would not dare to mention by name.6
Eban's justification for state terror is regarded as persuasive by respected authorities. As the current US-Israel assault raged, Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Israel's tactics in the current attack, as in its invasion of Lebanon in 2006, are based on the sound principle of ""trying to `educate' Hamas, by inflicting a heavy death toll on Hamas militants and heavy pain on the Gaza population."" That makes sense on pragmatic grounds, as it did in Lebanon, where ""the only long-term source of deterrence was to exact enough pain on the civilians -- the families and employers of the militants -- to restrain Hezbollah in the future."" And by similar logic, bin Laden's effort to ""educate"" Americans on 9/11 was highly praiseworthy, as were the Nazi attacks on Lidice and Oradour, Putin's destruction of Grozny, and other notable educational exercises.7
New York Times correspondent Stephen Erlanger reports that Israeli human rights groups are ""troubled by Israel's strikes on buildings they believe should be classified as civilian, like the parliament, police stations and the presidential palace"" - and, we may add, villages, homes, densely populated refugee camps, water and sewage systems, hospitals, schools and universities, mosques, UN relief facilities, ambulances, and indeed anything that might relieve the pain of the unworthy victims. A senior Israeli intelligence officer explained that the IDF attacked ""both aspects of Hamas -- its resistance or military wing and its dawa, or social wing,"" the latter a euphemism for the civilian society. ""He argued that Hamas was all of a piece,"" Erlanger continues, ""and in a war, its instruments of political and social control were as legitimate a target as its rocket caches."" Erlanger and his editors add no comment about the open advocacy, and practice, of massive terrorism targeting civilians, though correspondents and columnists signal their tolerance or even explicit advocacy of such crimes, as noted. But keeping to the norm, Erlanger does not fail to stress that unlike US-Israeli actions, Hamas rocketing is ""an obvious violation of the principle of discrimination and fits the classic definition of terrorism.""8
Like others familiar with the region, Middle East specialist Fawwaz Gerges observes that ""What Israeli officials and their American allies do not appreciate is that Hamas is not merely an armed militia but a social movement with a large popular base that is deeply entrenched in society."" Hence when they carry out their plans to destroy Hamas's ""social wing,"" they are aiming to destroy Palestinian society.9
Gerges may be too generous. It is highly unlikely that Israeli and American officials - or the media and other commentators - do not appreciate these facts. Rather, they implicitly adopt the traditional perspective of those who virtually monopolize the means of violence: our mailed fist can crush any opposition, and if our furious assault has a heavy civilian toll, that's all to the good: perhaps the remnants will be properly educated.
IDF officers clearly understand that they are crushing the civilian society. Ethan Bronner quotes an Israeli Colonel who says that he and his men are not much ""impressed with the Hamas fighters."" ""They are villagers with guns,"" said a gunner on an armored personnel carrier. They resemble the victims of the murderous IDF ""iron fist"" operations in occupied southern Lebanon in 1985, directed by Shimon Peres, one of the great terrorist commanders of the era of Reagan's ""War on Terror."" During these operations, Israeli commanders and strategic analysts explained that the victims were ""terrorist villagers,"" difficult to eradicate because ""these terrorists operate with the support of most of the local population."" An Israeli commander complained that ""the terrorist...has many eyes here, because he lives here,"" while the military correspondent of the Jerusalem Post described the problems Israeli forces faced in combating the ""terrorist mercenary,"" ""fanatics, all of whom are sufficiently dedicated to their causes to go on running the risk of being killed while operating against the IDF,"" which must ""maintain order and security"" in occupied southern Lebanon despite ""the price the inhabitants will have to pay."" The problem has been familiar to Americans in South Vietnam, Russians in Afghanistan, Germans in occupied Europe, and others who find themselves righteously implementing the Gur-Eban-Friedman doctrine.10
Gerges believes that US-Israeli state terror will fail: Hamas, he writes, ""cannot be wiped out without massacring half a million Palestinians. If Israel succeeds in killing Hamas's senior leaders, a new generation, more radical than the present, will swiftly replace them. Hamas is a fact of life. It is not going away, and it will not raise the white flag regardless of how many casualties it suffers.""
Perhaps, but there is often a tendency to underestimate the efficacy of violence. It is particularly odd that such a belief should be held in the United States. Why are we here?
Hamas is regularly described as ""Iranian-backed Hamas, which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel."" One will be hard put to find something like ""democratically elected Hamas, which has long been calling for a two-state settlement in accord with the international consensus"" -- blocked for over 30 years by the US and Israel. All true, but not a useful contribution to the Party Line, hence dispensable.
Such details as those mentioned earlier, though minor in context, nevertheless teach us something about ourselves and our clients. So do others. To mention another one, as the latest US-Israeli assault on Gaza began, a small boat, the Dignity, was on its way from Cyprus to Gaza. The doctors and human rights activists aboard intended to violate Israel's criminal blockade and to bring medical supplies to the trapped population. The ship was intercepted in international waters by Israeli naval vessels, which rammed it severely, almost sinking it, though it managed to limp to Lebanon. Israel issued the routine lies, refuted by the journalists and passengers aboard, including CNN correspondent Karl Penhaul and former US representative and Green Party presidential candidate Cynthia McKinney.11 That is a serious crime -- much worse, for example, than hijacking boats off the coast of Somalia. It passed with little notice. The tacit acceptance of such crimes reflects the understanding that Gaza is occupied territory, and that Israel is entitled to maintain its siege, and is even authorized by the guardians of international order to carry out crimes on the high seas to implement its programs of punishing the civilian population for disobedience to its commands - under pretexts to which we return, almost universally accepted but clearly untenable.
The lack of attention again makes sense. For decades, Israel had been hijacking boats in international waters between Cyprus and Lebanon, killing or kidnapping passengers, sometimes bringing them to prisons in Israel, including secret prison/torture chambers, to hold as hostages for many years.12 Since the practices are routine, why treat the new crime with more than a yawn? Cyprus and Lebanon reacted quite differently, but who are they in the scheme of things?
Who cares, for example, if the editors of Lebanon's Daily Star, generally pro-Western, write that ""Some 1.5 million people in Gaza are being subjected to the murderous ministrations of one of the world's most technologically advanced but morally regressive military machines. It is often suggested that the Palestinians have become to the Arab world what the Jews were to pre-World War II Europe, and there is some truth to this interpretation. How sickeningly appropriate, then, that just as Europeans and North Americans looked the other way when the Nazis were perpetrating the Holocaust, the Arabs are finding a way to do nothing as the Israelis slaughter Palestinian children.""13 Perhaps the most shameful of the Arab regimes is the brutal Egyptian dictatorship, the beneficiary of the most US military aid, apart from Israel.
According to Lebanese scholar Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, Israel still ""routinely abducts Lebanese civilians from the Lebanese side of the Blue Line , most recently in December 2008."" And of course ""Israeli planes violate Lebanese airspace on a daily basis in violation of UN Resolution 1701."" That too has been happening for a long time. In condemning Israel's double standards after its invasion of Lebanon in 2006, Israeli strategic analyst Zeev Maoz wrote that ""Israel has violated Lebanese airspace by carrying out aerial reconnaissance missions virtually every day since its withdrawal from Southern Lebanon six years ago. True, these aerial overflights did not cause any Lebanese casualties, but a border violation is a border violation. Here too, Israel does not hold a higher moral ground."" And in general, there is no basis for the ""wall-to-wall consensus in Israel that the war against the Hezbollah in Lebanon is a just and moral war,"" a consensus ""based on selective and short-term memory, on an introvert world view, and on double standards. This is not a just war, the use of force is excessive and indiscriminate, and its ultimate aim is extortion.""14
Maoz also reminds his Israeli readers that overflights with sonic booms to terrorize Lebanese are the least of Israeli crimes in Lebanon, even apart from its five invasions since 1978: ""On July 28, 1988 Israeli Special Forces abducted Sheikh Obeid, and on May 21, 1994 Israel abducted Mustafa Dirani, who was responsible for capturing the Israeli pilot Ron Arad . Israel held these and 20 other Lebanese who were captured under undisclosed circumstances in prison for prolonged periods without trial. They were held as human `bargaining chips.' Apparently, abduction of Israelis for the purpose of prisoners' exchange is morally reprehensible, and militarily punishable when it is the Hezbollah who does the abducting, but not if Israel is doing the very same thing."" And on a far grander scale and over many years.
Israel's regular practices are significant even apart from what they reveal about Israeli criminality and Western support for it. As Maoz indicates, these practices underscore the utter hypocrisy of the standard claim that Israel had the right to invade Lebanon once again in 2006 when soldiers were captured at the border, the first cross-border action by Hezbollah in the six years since Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, which it occupied in violation of Security Council orders going back 22 years, while during these six years after withdrawal Israel violated the border almost daily with impunity, and silence here.
The hypocrisy is, again, routine. Thus Thomas Friedman, while instructing us on how the lesser breeds are to be ""educated"" by terrorist violence, writes that Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 2006, once again destroying much of southern Lebanon and Beirut while killing another 1000 civilians, was a just act of self-defense, responding to Hezbollah's crime of ""launching an unprovoked war across the U.N.-recognized Israel-Lebanon border, after Israel had unilaterally withdrawn from Lebanon."" Similarly, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair John Kerry, speaking at the Brookings Institution, laments ""the failure of Israel's unilateral disengagements from Southern Lebanon and Gaza to bring peace"" (we return to its ""disengagement"" from Gaza). Putting aside the deceit, by the same logic, terrorist attacks against Israelis that are far more destructive and murderous than any that have taken place would be fully justified in response to Israel's criminal practices in Lebanon and on the high seas, which vastly exceed Hezbollah's crime of capturing two soldiers at the border. The veteran Middle East specialist of the New York Times surely knows about these crimes, at least if he reads his own newspaper: for example, the 18th paragraph of a story on prisoner exchange which observes, casually, that 37 of the Arab prisoners ""had been seized recently by the Israeli Navy as they tried to make their way from Cyprus to Tripoli,"" north of Beirut.15
Of course all such conclusions about appropriate actions against the rich and powerful are based on a fundamental flaw: This is us, and that is them. This crucial principle, deeply embedded in Western culture, suffices to undermine even the most precise analogy and the most impeccable reasoning.
The new crimes that the US and Israel were committing in Gaza as 2009 opened do not fit easily into any standard category - except for the category of familiarity; I have just mentioned several examples, and will return to others. Literally, the crimes fall under the official US government definition of ""terrorism,"" but that designation does not capture their enormity. They cannot be called ""aggression,"" because they are being conducted in occupied territory, as the US tacitly concedes, and as serious scholarship recognizes. In their comprehensive history of Israeli settlement in the occupied territories, Idith Zertal and Akiva Eldar point out that after Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza in August 2005, the ruined territory was not released ""for even a single day from Israel's military grip or from the price of the occupation that the inhabitants pay every day... Israel left behind scorched earth, devastated services, and people with neither a present nor a future. The settlements were destroyed in an ungenerous move by an unenlightened occupier, which in fact continues to control the territory and kill and harass its inhabitants by means of its formidable military might""16 - which can be exercised with extreme savagery, thanks to firm US support and participation.
The US-Israeli assault on Gaza escalated in January 2006, a few months after the formal withdrawal, when Palestinians committed a truly heinous crime: they voted ""the wrong way"" in a free election. Like others, Palestinians learned that one does not disobey with impunity the commands of the master, who never cease to orate about his ""yearning for democracy"" without eliciting ridicule from the educated classes, another impressive achievement.
Since the terms ""aggression"" and ""terrorism"" are inadequate, some new term is needed for the sadistic and cowardly torture of people caged with no possibility of escape, while they are being pounded to dust by the most sophisticated products of US military technology - used in violation of international and even US law, but for self-declared outlaw states that is just another minor technicality.
Also a minor technicality is the fact that on December 31, while terrorized Gazans were desperately seeking shelter from the ruthless assault, Washington hired a German merchant ship to transport from Greece to Israel 3000 tons of unidentified ""ammunition."" The new shipment ""follows the hiring of a commercial ship to carry a much larger consignment of ordnance in December from the United States to Israel ahead of air strikes in the Gaza Strip,"" Reuters reported. ""Israel's intervention in the Gaza Strip has been fueled largely by U.S. supplied weapons paid for with U.S. tax dollars,"" said a briefing by the New America Foundation, which monitors the arms trade. The new shipment was hampered by the decision of the Greek government to bar the use of any port in Greece ""for the supplying of the Israeli army.""
All of this is separate from the more than $21 billion in U.S. military aid provided by the Bush administration to Israel, almost all grants. Obama intends to ensure that the largesse extends far into the future, whatever circumstances might be down the road. He calls for ""sending up to $30 billion in unconditional military aid to Israel over the next 10 years,"" foreign policy analyst Stephen Zunes reports, a 25% increase over the Bush administration, and ""a bonanza for U.S. arms manufacturers, who contribute to candidates ""several times what the `pro-Israel' PACs contribute,"" and tirelessly ""promote massive arms transfers to the Middle East and elsewhere.""
Greece's response to US-backed Israeli crimes is rather different from the craven performance of the leaders of most of Europe. The distinction reveals that Washington may have been quite realistic in regarding Greece as part of the Near East, not Europe, until 1974. Perhaps Greece is just too civilized to be part of Europe.
For anyone who might find the timing of the new arms deliveries to Israel curious, the Pentagon has an answer: the shipment would arrive too late to escalate the Gaza attack, and the military equipment, whatever it may be, is to be pre-positioned in Israel for eventual use by the US military. That is quite plausible. One of the many services that Israel performs for its patron is to provide it with a valuable military base at the periphery of the world's major energy resources. It can therefore serve as a forward base for US aggression - or to use the technical terms, to ""defend the Gulf"" and ""ensure stability.""17
The huge flow of arms to Israel serves many subsidiary purposes. Middle East policy analyst Mouin Rabbani observes that Israel can test newly developed weapons systems against defenseless targets. This is of value to Israel and the US ""twice over, in fact, because less effective versions of these same weapons systems are subsequently sold at hugely inflated prices to Arab states, which effectively subsidizes the U.S. weapons industry and U.S. military grants to Israel.""18 These are additional functions of Israel in the US-dominated Middle East system, and among the reasons why Israel is so favored by the state authorities, along with a wide range of US high-tech corporations, and of course military industry and intelligence.
Israel apart, the US is by far the world's major arms supplier. The recent New America Foundation report concludes that ""U.S. arms and military training played a role in 20 of the world's 27 major wars in 2007,"" earning the US $23 billion in receipts, increasing to $32 billion in 2008. Small wonder that among the numerous UN resolutions that the US opposed in the December 2008 UN session was one calling for regulation of the arms trade. In 2006, the US was alone in voting against the treaty, but in November 2008 it was joined by a partner: Zimbabwe.19
There were other notable votes at the December UN session. A resolution on ""the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination"" was adopted by 173 to 5 (US, Israel, Pacific island dependencies; the US and Israel added evasive pretexts). The vote reaffirms US-Israeli rejectionism, in international isolation. Similarly a resolution on ""universal freedom of travel and the vital importance of family reunification"" was adopted over the opposition of the US, Israel, and Pacific dependencies, presumably with Palestinians in mind: Israel bars entry to Palestinians from the occupied territories who wish to join their Israeli spouses.
In voting against the right to development the US lost Israel but gained Ukraine. In voting against the ""right to food,"" the US was alone, a particular striking fact in the face of the enormous global food crisis, dwarfing the financial crisis that threatens western economies.
It is easy to understand why the UN voting record is consistently unreported and dispatched deep into the memory hole by the media and conformist intellectuals. It would not be wise to reveal to the public what the record implies about their elected representatives.
One of the heroic volunteers in Gaza, Norwegian doctor Mads Gilbert, described the scene of horror as an ""All out war against the civilian population of Gaza."" He estimated that half the casualties are women and children. Gilbert reports that he had scarcely seen a military casualty among the 100s of bodies. That is not too surprising. Hamas ""made a point of fighting at a distance -- or not at all,"" Ethan Bronner reports while ""parsing the gains"" of the US-Israeli assault. So Hamas's manpower remains intact, and it was mostly civilians who suffered pain: a positive outcome, according to widely-held doctrine.20
These estimates were confirmed by UN humanitarian chief John Holmes, who informed reporters that it is ""a fair presumption"" that most of the civilians killed were women and children in a humanitarian crisis that is ""worsening day by day as the violence continues."" But we could be comforted by the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, the leading dove in the ongoing electoral campaign, who assured the world that there is no ""humanitarian crisis"" in Gaza, thanks to Israeli benevolence.21
Like others who care about human beings and their fate, Gilbert and Holmes pleaded for a ceasefire. But not yet. ""At the United Nations, the United States prevented the Security Council from issuing a formal statement on Saturday night calling for an immediate ceasefire,"" the New York Times mentioned in passing. The official reason was that ""there was no indication Hamas would abide by any agreement."" In the annals of justifications for slaughter, this pretext must rank among the more cynical. That of course was Bush and Rice, soon to be displaced by Obama, who compassionately repeated that ""if missiles were falling where my two daughters sleep, I would do everything in order to stop that."" He was referring to Israeli children, not the many hundreds being torn to shreds in Gaza by US arms. Beyond that Obama maintained his silence. 22
A few days later, on January 8, the Security Council passed a resolution calling for a ""durable ceasefire."" The vote was 14-0, US abstaining. Israel and US hawks were angered that the US did not veto the resolution, as usual. The abstention, however, sufficed to give Israel at least a yellow light to escalate the violence, as it did right up to virtually the moment of the inauguration, as had been predicted.
As the ceasefire (theoretically) went into effect, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights released its figures for the final day of the assault: 54 Palestinians killed including 43 unarmed civilians, 17 of them children, while the IDF continued to bombard civilian homes and UN schools. The death toll, they estimated, mounted to 1,184, including 844 civilians, 281 of them children. The IDF continued to use incendiary bombs across the Gaza Strip, and to destroy houses and agricultural land, forcing civilians to flee their homes. A few hours later, Reuters reported more than 1,300 killed. The staff of the Al Mezan Center, which carefully monitors casualties and destruction, visited areas that had previously been inaccessible because of incessant heavy bombardment. They discovered dozens of civilian corpses decomposing under the rubble of destroyed houses or removed by Israeli bulldozers. Entire urban blocks had disappeared.23
The figures for killed and wounded are surely an underestimate. And it is unlikely that there will be any serious investigation of these atrocities, despite calls for an inquiry into war crimes by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem. Crimes of official enemies are subjected to rigorous investigation, but our own are systematically ignored. General practice, again, and understandable on the part of the masters, who rigorously adhere to a variant of the ""too big to fail"" insurance policy granted to major financial institutions by Washington, which provides them with great competitive advantages in a form of protectionism that is protected from the term. The US is just ""too big to hold to account,"" whether by judicial inquiry, boycott and sanctions, or other means.
The January 8 Security Council Resolution called for stopping the flow of arms into Gaza. The US and Israel (Rice-Livni) soon reached an agreement on measures to ensure this result, concentrating on Iranian arms. There is no need to stop smuggling of US arms into Israel, because there is no smuggling: the huge flow of arms is quite public, even when not reported, as in the case of the arms shipment announced as the slaughter in Gaza was proceeding. It was later learned that shortly after the end of its military attack on Gaza, Israel apparently also bombed Sudan, killing dozens of people, also sinking a ship in the Red Sea. The targets were suspected to be arms shipments intended for Gaza, so there was no reaction. An Iranian effort to impede the flow of US arms to the aggressor would have been regarded as a horrendous terrorist atrocity, which might well have led to nuclear war.24
The Resolution also called for ""ensur the sustained re-opening of the crossing points on the basis of the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access between the Palestinian Authority and Israel""; that Agreement determined that crossings to Gaza would be operated on a continuous basis and that Israel would also allow the crossing of goods and people between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The Rice-Livni agreement had nothing to say about this aspect of the Security Council Resolution. The US and Israel had abandoned the 2005 Agreement as part of their punishment of Palestinians for voting the wrong way in the January 2006 election. Rice's press conference after the 2009 Rice-Livni agreement emphasized Washington's continuing efforts to undermine the results of the one free election in the Arab world: ""There is much that can be done,"" she said, ""to bring Gaza out of the dark of Hamas's reign and into the light of the very good governance the Palestinian Authority can bring"" - at least, that it can bring as long as it remains a loyal client, rife with corruption and willing to carry out harsh repression, but obedient.25
Returning from a visit to the Arab world, Fawwaz Gerges strongly affirmed what others on the scene had reported. The effect of the US-Israeli offensive in Gaza has been to infuriate the populations and to arouse bitter hatred of the aggressors and their collaborators. ""Suffice it to say that the so-called moderate Arab states  are on the defensive, and that the resistance front led by Iran and Syria is the main beneficiary. Once again, Israel and the Bush administration have handed the Iranian leadership a sweet victory."" Furthermore, ""Hamas will likely emerge as a more powerful political force than before and will likely top Fatah, the ruling apparatus of President Mahmoud Abbas's Palestinian Authority,"" Washington's current favorite. That conclusion was reinforced by a poll by the independent Jerusalem Media and Communications Center, which found that support for Hamas in the West Bank rose from 19% the preceding April to 29% after the Gaza attack, while support for Fatah dropped from 34% to 30%. Far from weakening militant Islamist groups and their sponsors, the Center concluded, ""the war weakened and undermined to a very large extent the moderates -- not only in Palestine but also in the region."" 53% of West Bank Palestinians felt that Hamas had won the war, as compared with 10% who saw it as an Israeli victory.26
It is worth bearing in mind that the Arab world was not scrupulously protected from the only regular live TV coverage of what was happening in Gaza, namely the ""calm and balanced analysis of the chaos and destruction"" provided by the outstanding correspondents of al-Jazeera, offering ""a stark alternative to terrestrial channels,"" as reported by the London Financial Times. In the 105 countries lacking our efficient modalities of self-censorship, people could see what was happening hourly, and the impact is said to be very great. In the US, the New York Times reports, ""the near-total blackout...is no doubt related to the sharp criticism Al Jazeera received from the United States government during the initial stages of the war in Iraq for its coverage of the American invasion."" Cheney and Rumsfeld objected, so, obviously, the independent media could only obey.27
There is much sober debate about what the attackers hoped to achieve. Some of objectives are commonly discussed, among them, restoring what is called ""the deterrent capacity"" that Israel lost as a result of its failures in Lebanon in 2006 - that is, the capacity to terrorize any potential opponent into submission. There are, however, more fundamental objectives that tend be ignored, though they seem fairly obvious when we take a look at recent history.
Israel abandoned Gaza in September 2005. Rational Israeli hardliners, like Ariel Sharon, the patron saint of the settlers movement, understood that it was senseless to subsidize a few thousand illegal Israeli settlers in the ruins of Gaza, protected by a large part of the IDF while they used much of the land and scarce resources. It made more sense to turn all of Gaza into the world's largest prison and to transfer settlers to the West Bank, much more valuable territory, where Israel is quite explicit about its intentions, in word and more importantly in deed. One goal is to annex the arable land, water supplies, and pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that lie within the separation wall, irrelevantly declared illegal by the World Court. That includes a vastly expanded Jerusalem, in violation of Security Council orders that go back 40 years, also irrelevant. Israel has also been taking over the Jordan Valley, about one-third of the West Bank. What remains is therefore imprisoned, and, furthermore, broken into fragments by salients of Jewish settlement that trisect the territory: one to the east of Greater Jerusalem through the town of Ma'aleh Adumim, developed through the Clinton years to split the West Bank; and two to the north, through the towns of Ariel and Kedumim. What remains to Palestinians is segregated by hundreds of mostly arbitrary checkpoints.
The checkpoints have no relation to security of Israel, nor does the wall,28 and if intended to safeguard settlers, they are flatly illegal, as the World Court ruled definitively. In reality, their major goal is to harass the Palestinian population and to fortify what Israeli peace activist Jeff Halper calls the ""matrix of control,"" designed to make life unbearable for the ""drugged roaches scurrying around in a bottle"" who seek to remain in their homes and land. All of that is fair enough, because they are ""like grasshoppers compared to us"" so that their heads can be ""smashed against the boulders and walls."" The terminology is from the highest Israeli political and military leaders, in this case the revered ""princes."" And similar attitudes, even if more discretely expressed, shape policies.29
The racist rhetoric of political and military leaders is mild as compared to the preaching of rabbinical authorities. They are not marginal figures. On the contrary, they are highly influential in the army and in the settler movement, which Zertal and Eldar describe for good reason as the ""lords of the land,"" with enormous impact on policy. One of the memorable photographs from the Gaza war showed three orthodox Jews in traditional black garb with the caption ""Israelis, like these men, have come to hills near Gaza to watch their forces pound the Palestinian enclave in an attempt to stop Hamas rocket attacks"" (an attempt to which we return. The story describes how Israelis, orthodox and secular, come to the hilltops that have ""become the war's peanut gallery,... some with lunches and portable radios tuned to the latest reports of the battle raging in front of them,  to egg on friends and family members in the fight,  shouting `Bravo, Bravo!,"" as they watch the exploding bombs hardly able to contain their glee, some with their binoculars and lawn chairs. criticizing the Israeli attackers for hitting the wrong targets, much like fans at sporting events who criticize the coach.30
Soldiers fighting in northern Gaza were afforded an ""inspirational"" visit from two leading rabbis, who explained to them that there are no ""innocents"" in Gaza, so everyone there is a legitimate target, quoting a famous passage from Psalms calling on the Lord to seize the infants of Israel's oppressors and dash them against the rocks. The rabbis were breaking no new ground. A year earlier, the former chief Sephardic rabbi wrote to Prime Minister Olmert, informing him that all civilians in Gaza are collectively guilty for rocket attacks, so that there is ""absolutely no moral prohibition against the indiscriminate killing of civilians during a potential massive military offensive on Gaza aimed at stopping the rocket launchings,"" as the Jerusalem Post reported his ruling. His son, chief rabbi of Safed, elaborated: ""If they don't stop after we kill 100, then we must kill a thousand, and if they do not stop after 1,000 then we must kill 10,000. If they still don't stop we must kill 100,000, even a million. Whatever it takes to make them stop.""31
Similar views are expressed by prominent American intellectuals. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 2006, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz explained in the liberal online journal Huffington Post that all Lebanese are legitimate targets of Israeli violence. Lebanon's citizens are ""paying the price"" for supporting ""terrorism"" - that is, for supporting resistance to Israel's invasion. Accordingly, the vast majority of Lebanese civilians are no more immune to attack than Austrians who supported the Nazis. The fatwa of the Sephardic rabbi applies to them. In a video on the Jerusalem Post website, Dershowitz went on to ridicule talk of excessive kill ratios of Palestinians to Israelis: they should be increased to 1000 to one, he said, or even 1000 to zero, meaning that the brutes should be completely exterminated. Of course, he is referring to ""terrorists,"" a broad category that includes the victims of Israeli power, since ""Israel never targets civilians,"" he emphatically declared. It follows that Palestinians, Lebanese, Tunisians, in fact anyone who gets in the way of the ruthless armies of the Holy State is a terrorist, or an accidental victim of their just crimes.32
It is not easy to find historical counterparts to these performances. It is perhaps of some interest that they elicit virtually no censure and are thus apparently considered entirely appropriate in the reigning intellectual and moral culture - when they are produced on ""our side,"" that is. From the mouths of official enemies such words would elicit righteous outrage and calls for massive preemptive violence to punish the villains.
The claim that ""our side"" never targets civilians is familiar doctrine in violent states. And there is some truth to it. Powerful states, like the United States, do not generally try to kill particular civilians. Rather, they carry out murderous actions that they and their educated classes know will slaughter many civilians, but without specific intent to kill particular ones. In law, the routine practices might fall under the category of depraved indifference, but that is not an adequate designation for standard imperial practice and doctrine. It is more similar to walking down a street knowing that we might kill ants, but without intent to do so, because they rank so low that it just doesn't matter. Thus Clinton's bombing of the main pharmaceutical plant in a poor African country (Sudan) might be expected to lead to the deaths of tens of thousands of people, as it apparently did. But since we did not aim at particular ones, there is no guilt, Western moralists assure us. And the same holds in much more extreme cases, which are all too easy to enumerate. The same is true when Israel carries out actions that it knows will kill the ""grasshoppers"" and ""drugged roaches"" who happen to infest the lands it ""liberates."" There is no good term for this form of moral depravity, arguably worse than deliberate slaughter, and all too familiar.
In the former Palestine, the rightful owners (by divine decree, according to the ""lords of the land"") may decide to grant the drugged roaches a few scattered parcels. Not by right, however: ""I believed, and to this day still believe, in our people's eternal and historic right to this entire land,"" Prime Minister Olmert informed a joint session of Congress in May 2006 to rousing applause. At the same time he announced his ""convergence"" program for taking over what is valuable in the West Bank, as outlined earlier, leaving the Palestinians to rot in isolated cantons. He was not specific about the borders of the ""entire land,"" but then, the Zionist enterprise never has been, for good reasons: permanent expansion is an important internal dynamic. If Olmert was still faithful to his origins in Likud, he might have meant both sides of the Jordan, including the current state of Jordan, at least valuable parts of it, though the 1999 Likud Charter - the program of current Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu - is ambiguous. It declares that ""the Jordan Valley and the territories that dominate it shall be under Israeli sovereignty."" What ""dominates"" the Jordan Valley is not defined, but it certainly includes everything to the West of the Jordan, the former Palestine, to remain under Israeli sovereignty. Within that territory there can never be a Palestinian state and settlement must be unconstrained, the Charter declares, since ""Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel.""
For Olmert and his Likud successor, our people's ""eternal and historic right to this entire land"" contrasts dramatically with the lack of any right of self-determination for the temporary visitors, the Palestinians. As noted earlier, the lack of any such right was reiterated by Israel and its patron in Washington in December 2008, in their usual isolation and accompanied by the usual resounding silence.33
The plans that Olmert sketched in 2006 were later abandoned as not sufficiently extreme. But what replaces the convergence program, and the actions that proceed daily to implement it, are approximately the same in general conception. In 2008, West Bank settlement construction rose by 60%, according to a report by Peace Now, which monitors settlement. Housing starts in West Bank settlements rose by 46% over the previous year, while they declined in Tel Aviv by 29% and in Jerusalem by 14%. Peace Now reported further that some 6000 new units had been approved with 58,000 waiting approval: ""If all the plans are realized,"" the report said, ""the number of settlers in the territories will be doubled."" There are many ways to expand the settlement project without eliciting protest from the paymasters in Washington, for example, setting up an ""outpost"" that is later linked to the national electricity and water grids and over time slowly becomes a settlement or a town. Or simply by expanding the ""rings of land"" around a settlement for alleged security reasons, seizing Palestinian lands, all processes that continue.34
These devices, which have roots in the pre-state period, trace back to the earliest days of the occupation, when the basic idea was formulated poetically by Defense Minister Moshe Dayan, who was in charge of the occupied territories: ""the situation today resembles the complex relationship between a Bedouin man and the girl he kidnaps against his will...You Palestinians, as a nation, don't want us today, but we'll change your attitude by forcing our presence on you."" You will ""live like dogs, and whoever will leave, will leave,"" while we take what we want.35
That these programs are criminal has never been in doubt. Immediately after the 1967 war, the Israeli government was informed by its highest legal authority, Teodor Meron, that ""civilian settlement in the administered territories contravenes the explicit provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention,"" the foundation of international humanitarian law. Israel's Justice Minister concurred. Dayan conceded that ""Settling Israelis in occupied territories contravenes, as is known, international conventions, but there is nothing essentially new in that,"" so the issue can be dismissed. The World Court unanimously endorsed Meron's conclusion in 2004, and the Israeli High Court technically agreed while disagreeing in practice, in its usual style.36
In the West Bank, Israel can pursue its criminal programs with US support and no disturbance, thanks to its effective military control and by now the cooperation of the collaborationist Palestinian security forces armed and trained by the US and allied dictatorships. It can also carry out regular assassinations and other crimes, while settlers rampage under IDF protection. But while the West Bank has been effectively subdued by terror, there is still resistance in the other half of Palestine, the Gaza Strip. That too must be quelled for the US-Israeli programs of annexation and destruction of Palestine to proceed undisturbed.
Hence the invasion of Gaza.
The timing of the invasion was widely assumed to be influenced by the coming Israeli election. Defense Minister Ehud Barak of the centrist Labor Party, who was lagging badly in the polls, gained one parliamentary seat for every 40 Arabs killed in the early days of the slaughter, Israeli commentator Ran HaCohen calculated.37
That changed, however. The Israeli far right gained substantially from the invasion, though as the crimes passed beyond what the carefully honed Israeli propaganda campaign was able to suppress, even confirmed supporters of the invasion became concerned about the way the outside world was perceiving Israel's just war. The highly regarded political scientist and historian Shlomo Avineri offered an analysis of these ""critical differences of opinion"" between Israel and outsiders. Among the causes, he explained, were ""the harsh images -- a consequence of the firepower Israel used, as magnified by the media -- as well as disinformation and, undoubtedly, plain old hatred of Israel."" But he discerned a deeper reason: ""the name given to the operation, which greatly affects the way in which it will be perceived. Israelis associate the Hebrew for Cast Lead, as the operation was called, with a line written by poet Haim Nahman Bialik that is part of a Hanukkah song typically sung by cute little children. The fact that the operation began around Hanukkah sharpened that association. Abroad, however, it was seen differently. In English, not to mention German, Cast Lead has a whole other association. Lead is cast into bullets, bombs and mortar shells. When the world reported on Cast Lead it sounded militaristic, brutal and aggressive; it was associated with death and destruction rather than spinning dreidels. Even before the first shot was fired or the first speech explaining Israel's case was made, the operation had already acquired an image of belligerence,"" a terrible failure of Israeli hasbara. Perhaps it should have been called something more gentle, Avineri felt, ""like the Gates of Gaza, which also has a historical ring to it.""38
Other war supporters warned that the carnage is ""Destroying  soul and its image. Destroying it on world television screens, in the living rooms of the international community and most importantly, in Obama's America"" (Ari Shavit). Shavit was particularly concerned about Israel's ""shelling a United Nations facility...on the day when the UN secretary general is visiting Jerusalem,"" an act that is ""beyond lunacy,"" he felt.39
Adding a few details, the ""facility"" was the UN compound in Gaza City, which contained the UNRWA warehouse. The shelling destroyed ""hundreds of tons of emergency food and medicines set for distribution today to shelters, hospitals and feeding centres,"" according to UNRWA director John Ging. Military strikes at the same time destroyed two floors of the al-Quds hospital, setting it ablaze, and also a second warehouse run by the Palestinian Red Crescent society. The hospital in the densely-populated Tal-Hawa neighbourhood was destroyed by Israeli tanks ""after hundreds of frightened Gazans had taken shelter inside as Israeli ground forces pushed into the neighbourhood,"" Al-Jazeera reported.
There was nothing left to salvage inside the smoldering ruins of the hospital. ""They shelled the building, the hospital building,"" paramedic Ahmad Al-Haz told AP. ""It caught fire. We tried to evacuate the sick people and the injured and the people who were there. Firefighters arrived and put out the fire, which burst into flames again and they put it out again and it came back for the third time."" It was suspected that the blaze might have been set by white phosphorus, also suspected in numerous other fires and serious burn injuries.40
The suspicions were confirmed by Amnesty International after the cessation of the intense bombardment made inquiry possible. Israel had sensibly barred all journalists, even Israeli, while its crimes were proceeding in full fury. Israel's use of white phosphorus against Gaza civilians is ""clear and undeniable,"" AI reported, condemning its repeated use in densely populated civilian areas as ""a war crime."" AI investigators found white phosphorus edges scattered around residential buildings, still burning, ""further endangering the residents and their property,"" particularly children ""drawn to the detritus of war and often unaware of the danger."" Primary targets, they report, were the UNRWA compound, where the Israeli ""white phosphorus landed next to some fuel trucks and caused a large fire which destroyed tons of humanitarian aid"" after Israeli authorities ""had given assurance that no further strikes would be launched on the compound."" On the same day, ""a white phosphorus shell landed in the al-Quds hospital in Gaza City also causing a fire which forced hospital staff to evacuate the patients... White phosphorus landing on skin can burn deep through muscle and into the bone, continuing to burn unless deprived of oxygen."" Whether purposely intended or beyond depraved indifference, such crimes are inevitable when the weapon is used in attacks on civilians. 41
The white phosphorus shells were US-made, AI reported. In a report reviewing use of weapons in Gaza, AI concluded that Israel used US-supplied weapons in ""serious violations of international humanitarian law,"" and called on ""the U.N. Security Council to impose an immediate and comprehensive arms embargo on the Jewish state.""42 Though conscious US complicity is hardly in doubt, it is excluded from the call for punishment by the analogue of the ""too big to fail"" doctrine.
It is, however, a mistake to concentrate too much on Israel's severe violations of jus in bello, the laws designed to bar wartime practices that are too savage. The invasion itself is a far more serious crime. And if Israel had inflicted horrendous damage by bows and arrows, it would still be a criminal act of extreme depravity.
It is also a mistake to focus attention on specific targets. The campaign was far more ambitious in scope. Its goal was ""the destruction of all means of life,"" officials warned. A large part of the agricultural land was destroyed, some perhaps permanently, along with poultry, livestock, greenhouses, orchards, creating a major food crisis, the World Food Program reported. The IDF also targeted the Ministry of Agriculture and ""the offices of the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees in Zaitoun -- which provides cheap food for the poor - ransacked and vandalised by soldiers who left abusive graffiti."" Large areas were flattened by bulldozers. Beyond ""the physical damage done by Israeli bulldozers, bombing and shelling, land has been contaminated by munitions, including white phosphorus, burst sewerage pipes, animal carcasses and even asbestos used in roofing. In many places, the damage is extreme. In Jabal al-Rayas, once a thriving farming community, every building has been knocked down, and even the cattle killed and left to lie rotting in the fields."" Leaders of Gaza's business community, generally apolitical, ""say that much of the 3 per cent of industry still operating after the 18-month shutdown caused by Israel's economic siege has now been destroyed"" by Israeli forces using ""aerial bombing, tank shelling and armoured bulldozers to eliminate the productive capacity of some of Gaza's most important manufacturing plants,"" destroying or severely damaging 219 factories, according to Palestinian industrialists.43
To impede potential recovery, the IDF attacked universities, largely destroying the agriculture faculty at al-Azhar university (considered pro-Fatah, Washington's favored faction), Al-Da'wa College for Humanities in Rafah, and the Gaza College for Security Sciences. Six university buildings in Gaza were razed to the ground and 16 damaged. Two of those destroyed housed the science and engineering laboratories of the Islamic University in Gaza.44 The pretext was that they contributed to Hamas military activities. By the same principle, Israeli (and US) universities are legitimate targets of large-scale terror.
There were occasional reports of the Israeli navy firing on fishing boats, but these conceal what appears to be a systematic campaign in recent years to drive the fishing industry towards shore - thereby destroying it, because the vast pollution caused by Israel's destruction of power stations and sewage facilities makes fishing impossible near shore. Citing recent incidents, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights in Gaza, which has been a highly reliable source, ""strongly condemn the continuous escalation of the IOF  offensive against Palestinian civilians, including fishermen."" International human rights observers report regular attacks on fishing vessels in Gazan territorial waters. Accompanying Palestinian fishers, they report having ""witnessed countless acts of Israeli military aggression against them whilst in Gazan territorial waters, despite a six-month ceasefire agreement holding at the time,"" and now again after the January ceasefire. ""Gaza's 40,000 fishermen have been deprived of their livelihood"" by Israel naval attacks, Gideon Levy reported from the bedside of a 19-year-old Gaza fisherman, severely wounded by Israeli gunboats who attacked his boat without warning near the Gaza shore on October 5, a month before the ceasefire was broken by Israel's invasion of Gaza, events to which we return. ""Every few days the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) publishes reports from its volunteers in Gaza about attacks on fishermen. Sometimes the naval boats ram the wretched craft, sometimes the sailors use high-pressure water hoses on the fishermen, hurtling them into the sea, and sometimes they open lethal fire on them,"" Levy reported.45
The international observers report that attacks on fishing boats began after the discovery of quite promising natural gas fields by the BG Group in 2000, in Gaza's territorial waters. The regular attacks gradually drove fishing boats towards shore, not by official order but by threat and violence. Oil industry journals and the Israeli business press report that Israel's state-owned Israel Electric Corp. is negotiating ""for as much as 1.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas from the Marine field located off the Mediterranean coast of the Palestinian controlled Gaza Strip."" It is hard to suppress the thought that the Gaza invasion may be related to the project of stealing these valuable resources from Palestine, which cannot take part in the negotiations.46
Aggression always has a pretext: in this case, that Israel's patience had ""run out"" in the face of Hamas rocket attacks, as Ehud Barak put it. The mantra that is endlessly repeated is that Israel has the right to use force to defend itself. The thesis is partially defensible. The rocketing is criminal, and it is true that a state has the right to defend itself against criminal attacks. But it does not follow that it has a right to defend itself by force. That goes far beyond any principle that we would or should accept. Putin had no right to use force in response to Chechen terror - and his resort to force is not justified by the fact that he achieved results so far beyond what the US achieved in Iraq that if General Petraeus had approached them, he might have been crowned king.47 Nazi Germany had no right to use force to defend itself against the terrorism of the partisans. Kristallnacht was not justified by Herschel Grynszpan's assassination of a German Embassy official in Paris. The British were not justified in using force to defend themselves against the (very real) terror of the American colonists seeking independence, or to terrorize Irish Catholics in response to IRA terror - and when they finally turned to the sensible policy of addressing legitimate grievances, the terror virtually ended. It is not a matter of ""proportionality,"" but of choice of action in the first place: Is there an alternative to violence? In all of these cases, there plainly was, so the resort to force had no justification whatsoever.
Any resort to force carries a heavy burden of proof, and we have to ask whether it can be met in the case of Israel's effort to quell any resistance to its daily criminal actions in Gaza and in the West Bank, where they still continue relentlessly after more than 40 years. Perhaps I may quote myself in an interview in the Israeli press on the legitimacy of Palestinian resistance: ""We should recall that Gaza and the West Bank are recognized to be a unit, so that if resistance to Israel's destructive and illegal programs is legitimate within the West Bank (and it would be interesting to see a rational argument to the contrary), then it is legitimate in Gaza as well.""48
Palestinian-American journalist Ali Abunimah observed that ""There are no rockets launched at Israel from the West Bank, and yet Israel's extrajudicial killings, land theft, settler pogroms and kidnappings never stopped for a day during the truce. The western-backed Palestinian Authority of Mahmoud Abbas has acceded to all Israel's demands. Under the proud eye of United States military advisors, Abbas has assembled `security forces' to fight the resistance on Israel's behalf. None of that has spared a single Palestinian in the West Bank from Israel's relentless colonization"" - thanks to firm US backing. The respected Palestinian parliamentarian Dr. Mustapha Barghouti adds that after Bush's Annapolis extravaganza in November 2007, with much uplifting rhetoric about dedication to peace and justice, Israeli attacks on Palestinians escalated in the West Bank, along with a sharp increase in settlements and Israeli check points. Obviously these criminal actions are not a response to rockets from Gaza, though the converse may well be the case.49
The actions of people resisting brutal occupation can be condemned as criminal and politically foolish, but those who offer no alternative have no moral standing to issue such judgments. The conclusion holds with particular force for Americans who choose to be directly implicated in Israel's ongoing crimes -- by their words, their actions, or their silence. All the more so because there are very clear non-violent alternatives - which, however, have the disadvantage that they bar the programs of illegal expansion that the US strongly supports in practice, while occasionally issuing a mild admonition that they are ""unhelpful.""50
Israel has straightforward means to defend itself: put an end to its criminal actions in occupied territories, and accept the long-standing international consensus on a two-state settlement that has been blocked by the US and Israel for over 30 years, since the US first vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for a political settlement in these terms in 1976. I will not once again run through the inglorious record, but it is important to be aware that US-Israeli rejectionism today is even more blatant than in the past. The Arab League has gone even beyond the consensus, calling for full normalization of relations with Israel. Hamas has repeatedly called for a two-state settlement in terms of the international consensus. Iran and Hezbollah have made it clear that they will abide by any agreement that Palestinians accept.51
One can seek ambiguities and incompleteness, but not in the case of the US-Israel, which remain in splendid isolation, not only in words.
The more detailed record is informative. The Palestinian National Council formally accepted the international consensus in 1988. The response of the Shamir-Peres coalition government, affirmed by James Baker's State Department, was that there cannot be an ""additional Palestinian state"" between Israel and Jordan - the latter already a Palestinian state by US-Israeli dictate. The Oslo accords that followed explicitly put to the side potential Palestinian national rights: the Declaration of Principles signed with much fanfare on the White House lawn in September 1993 referred only to UN 242, which grants nothing to the Palestinians, while pointedly ignoring subsequent UN declarations, all blocked by Washington, which respect Palestinian national rights. The threat that these rights might be realized in some meaningful form was systematically undermined through the Oslo years by Israel's steady expansion of illegal settlements, with US support. Settlement accelerated in 2000, President Clinton's and Prime Minister Barak's last year, when negotiations took place at Camp David against that background.
After blaming Yassir Arafat for the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations, Clinton backtracked, and recognized that the US-Israeli proposals were too extreme to be acceptable to any Palestinian. In December 2000, he presented his ""parameters,"" vague but more forthcoming. He then announced that both sides had accepted the parameters, while both expressed reservations. The two sides met in Taba Egypt in January 2001 - four months after the outbreak of the intifida -- and came very close to an agreement. They would have been able to do so in a few more days, they said in their final press conference. But the negotiations were cancelled prematurely by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. That week in Taba is the one break in over 30 years of US-Israeli rejectionism. There is no reason why that one break in the record cannot be resumed.52
The preferred version, reiterated by Ethan Bronner, is that ""Many abroad recall Mr. Barak as the prime minister who in 2000 went further than any Israeli leader in peace offers to the Palestinians, only to see the deal fail and explode in a violent Palestinian uprising  that drove him from power."" It is quite true that ""many abroad"" believe this deceitful fairy tale, thanks to what Bronner and too many of his colleagues call ""journalism.""53
It is commonly claimed that a two-state solution is now unattainable because if the IDF tried to remove settlers, it would lead to a civil war. That may be true, but much more argument is needed. Without resorting to force to expel illegal settlers, the IDF could simply withdraw to whatever boundaries are established by negotiations. The settlers beyond those boundaries would have the choice of leaving their subsidized homes to return to subsidized homes in Israel, or to remain under Palestinian authority. The same was true of the carefully staged ""national trauma"" in Gaza in 2005, so transparently fraudulent that it was ridiculed by Israeli commentators. It would have sufficed for Israel to announce that the IDF would withdraw, and the settlers who were subsidized to enjoy their life in Gaza would have quietly climbed into the lorries provided to them and travelled to their new subsidized residences in the other occupied territories. But that would not have produced tragic photos of agonized children and passionate calls of ""never again,"" thus providing a welcome propaganda cover for the real purpose of the partial ""disengagement"": expansion of illegal settlement in the rest of the occupied territories.54
To summarize, contrary to the claim that is constantly reiterated, Israel has no right to use force to defend itself against rockets from Gaza, even if they are regarded as terrorist crimes. Furthermore, the reasons are transparent. The pretext for launching the attack is without merit.
There is also a narrower question. Does Israel have peaceful short-term alternatives to the use of force in response to rockets from Gaza. One such alternative would be to accept a ceasefire. Sometimes Israel has formally done so, while quickly violating it. The most recent and currently relevant case is June 2008. The ceasefire called for opening the border crossings to ""allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza."" Israel formally agreed, but immediately announced that it would not abide by the agreement and open the borders until Hamas released Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier captured by Hamas in June 2006.55
After the Gaza invasion, Israel continued to reject Hamas proposals of a ceasefire and long-term truce, again citing the capture of Shalit. Partly on the same grounds, it refused to permit any reconstruction, even the import of macaroni, crayons, tomato paste, lentils, soap, toilet paper, and other such weapons of mass destruction - eliciting some polite queries from Washington.56
The steady drumbeat of accusations about the capture of Shalit is, again, blatant hypocrisy, even putting aside Israel's long history of kidnapping. In this case, the hypocrisy could not be more glaring. One day before Hamas captured Shalit, Israeli soldiers entered Gaza City and kidnapped two civilians, the Muamar brothers, bringing them to Israel to join the thousands of other prisoners held there, hundreds reportedly without charge. Kidnapping civilians is a far more serious crime than capturing a soldier of an attacking army, but as is the norm, it was barely reported in contrast to the furor over Shalit. And all that remains in memory, blocking peace, is the capture of Shalit, another illustration of the depth of imperial mentality in the West. Shalit should be returned - in a fair prisoner exchange.57
It was after the capture of Shalit that Israel's unrelenting military attack against Gaza passed from merely vicious to truly sadistic. But it is well to recall that even before his capture, Israel had fired more than 7,700 shells at northern Gaza after its September withdrawal, eliciting virtually no comment.58
After immediately rejecting the June 2008 ceasefire it had formally accepted, Israel maintained its siege. We may recall that a siege is an act of war. In fact, Israel has always insisted on an even stronger principle: hampering access to the outside world, even well short of a siege, is an act of war, justifying massive violence in response. Interference with Israel's passage through the Straits of Tiran was a large part of the justification offered for Israel's invasion of Egypt (with France and England) in 1956, and for its launching of the June 1967 war. The siege of Gaza is total, not partial, apart from occasional willingness of the occupiers to relax it slightly. And it is vastly more harmful to Gazans than closing the Straits of Tiran was to Israel. Supporters of Israeli doctrines and actions should therefore have no problem justifying rocket attacks on Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip.
Of course, again we run into the nullifying principle: This is us, that is them.
Israel not only maintained the siege after June 2008, but did so with extreme rigor. It even prevented UNRWA from replenishing its stores, ""so when the ceasefire broke down, we ran out of food for the 750,000 who depend on us,"" UNRWA director John Ging informed the BBC.59
Despite the Israeli siege, rocketing sharply reduced. According to the spokesperson for the Prime Minister, Mark Regev, there was not a single Hamas rocket among the few that were launched from the onset of the June 2008 ceasefire until November 4, when Israel violated it still more egregiously with a raid into Gaza, leading to the death of 6 Palestinians and a retaliatory barrage of rockets (with no injuries). The raid was on the evening of the US presidential elections, when attention was focused elsewhere. The pretext for the raid was that Israel had detected a tunnel in Gaza that might have been intended for use to capture another Israeli soldier; a ""ticking tunnel"" in official communiques. The pretext was transparently absurd, as a number of commentators noted. If such a tunnel existed, and reached the border, Israel could easily have barred it right there. But as usual, the ludicrous Israeli pretext was deemed credible, and the timing was overlooked.60
What was the reason for the Israeli raid? We have no internal evidence about Israeli planning, but we do know that the raid came shortly before scheduled Hamas-Fatah talks in Cairo aimed at ""reconciling their differences and creating a single, unified government,"" British correspondent Rory McCarthy reported. That was to be the first Fatah-Hamas meeting since the June 2007 civil war that left Hamas in control of Gaza, and would have been a significant step towards advancing diplomatic efforts. There is a long history of Israel provocations to deter the threat of diplomacy, some already mentioned. This may have been another one.61
The civil war that left Hamas in control of Gaza is commonly described as a Hamas military coup, demonstrating again their evil nature. The real world a little different. The civil war was incited by the US and Israel, in a crude attempt at a military coup to overturn the free elections that brought Hamas to power. That has been public knowledge at least since April 2008, when David Rose published a detailed and documented account of how Bush, Rice, and Deputy National-Security Adviser Elliott Abrams ""backed an armed force under Fatah strongman Muhammad Dahlan, touching off a bloody civil war in Gaza and leaving Hamas stronger than ever."" The account was corroborated by Norman Olsen, who served for 26 years in the Foreign Service, including four years working in the Gaza Strip and four years at the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, and then moved on to become associate coordinator for counterterrorism at the Department of State. Olson and his son detail the State Department shenanigans intended to ensure that their candidate, Abbas, would win in the January 2006 elections - in which case it would have been hailed as a triumph of democracy. After the election-fixing failed, the US and Israel turned to the punishment of Palestinians for voting the wrong way, and began arming a militia run by Fatah strong-man Muhammad Dahlan. But ""Dahlan's thugs moved too soon,"" the Olsons write, and a Hamas pre-emptive strike undermined the coup attempt.62
The Party Line is more convenient.
The US-Israel responded to the failed coup attempt by introducing far harsher measures to punish the people of Gaza, and to ensure that that the plague of disobedience would not spread to the rest of Palestine. Together with Jordan, the US undertook to arm and train more efficient Palestinian ""security force"" to maintain order in the West Bank, under the direction of US General Keith Dayton. Israeli military officers participate as well, Ethan Bronner reported in the New York Times, describing how ""An Israeli officer inaugurated the firing range here, shooting a Palestinian weapon to test it and give his seal of approval."" The major achievement of the new paramilitary force, Bronner elaborated, was to have ""maintained tight order"" to prevent any kind of ""uprising"" - that is, significant show of sympathy and support - while Israel slaughtered Palestinians in Gaza and reduced much of it to rubble.
The effective performance of these forces also impressed Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair John Kerry. In his address to the Brookings Institution, he spoke eloquently of ""the need to give the Israelis a legitimate partner for peace,"" which they evidently lacked during the decades of unilateral US-Israeli rejection of the international consensus on a peace settlement, which the Palestinian Liberation Organization supported, along with the Arab states (and the world, outside the US-Israel). We must overcome this failure, Kerry explained, suggesting several ways to weaken the elected government and strengthen our man Mahmoud Abbas. ""Most importantly,"" Kerry went on, ""this means strengthening General Dayton's efforts to train Palestinian security forces that can keep order and fight terror...Recent developments have been extremely encouraging: During the invasion of Gaza, Palestinian Security Forces largely succeeded in maintaining calm in the West Bank amidst widespread expectations of civil unrest. Obviously, more remains to be done, but we can help do it.""63
So we can. The US has had a century of rich experience in developing paramilitary and police forces to pacify conquered populations and to impose the structure of a long-lasting coercive security state that undermines nationalist and popular aspirations and sustains obedience to the wealthy classes and their foreign associates.64
After Israel broke the June 2008 ceasefire (such as it was) in November, the siege was tightened further, with even more disastrous consequences for the population. According to Sara Roy, the leading academic specialist on Gaza, ""On Nov. 5, Israel sealed all crossing points into Gaza, vastly reducing and at times denying food supplies, medicines, fuel, cooking gas, and parts for water and sanitation systems"" ""During November, an average of 4.6 trucks of food per day entered Gaza from Israel compared with an average of 123 trucks per day in October. Spare parts for the repair and maintenance of water-related equipment have been denied entry for over a year. The World Health Organization just reported that half of Gaza's ambulances are now out of order"" - and the rest soon became targets for Israeli attack. Gaza's only power station was forced to suspend operation for lack of fuel, and could not be started up again because they needed spare parts, which had been sitting in the Israeli port of Ashdod for 8 months. Shortage of electricity led to a 300% increase in burn cases at Shifaa' hospital in the Gaza Strip, resulting from efforts to light wood fires. Israel barred shipment of Chlorine, so that by mid-December in Gaza City and the north access to water was limited to six hours every three days. The human consequences are not counted among Palestinian victims of Israeli terror.65
After the November 4 Israeli attack, both sides escalated violence (all deaths were Palestinian) until the ceasefire formally ended on Dec. 19, and Prime Minister Olmert authorized the full-scale invasion.
A few days earlier Hamas had proposed to return to the original July ceasefire agreement, which Israel had not observed. Historian and former Carter administration high official Robert Pastor passed the proposal to a ""senior official"" in the IDF, but Israel did not respond. The head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, was quoted in Israeli sources on December 21 as saying that Hamas is interested in continuing the ""calm"" with Israel, while its military wing is continuing preparations for conflict.
""There clearly was an alternative to the military approach to stopping the rockets,"" Pastor said, keeping to the narrow issue of Gaza. There was also a more far-reaching alternative, which is rarely discussed: namely, accepting a political settlement including all of the occupied territories.66
Israel's senior diplomatic correspondent Akiva Eldar reports that shortly before Israel launched its full-scale invasion on Saturday Dec. 27, ""Hamas politburo chief Khaled Meshal announced on the Iz al-Din al-Qassam Web site that he was prepared not only for a `cessation of aggression' -- he proposed going back to the arrangement at the Rafah crossing as of 2005, before Hamas won the elections and later took over the region. That arrangement was for the crossing to be managed jointly by Egypt, the European Union, the Palestinian Authority presidency and Hamas,"" and as noted earlier, called for opening of the crossings to desperately needed supplies.67
A standard claim of the more vulgar apologists for Israeli violence is that in the case of the current assault, ""as in so many instances in the past half century - the Lebanon War of 1982, the `Iron Fist' response to the 1988 intifada, the Lebanon War of 2006 - the Israelis have reacted to intolerable acts of terror with a determination to inflict terrible pain, to teach the enemy a lesson. The civilian suffering and deaths are inevitable; the lessons less so"" (New Yorker editor David Remnick).68 The 2006 invasion can be justified only on the grounds of appalling cynicism, as already discussed. The reference to the vicious response to the 1988 intifada is too depraved even to discuss; a sympathetic interpretation might be that it reflects astonishing ignorance. But Remnick's claim about the 1982 invasion is quite common, a remarkable feat of incessant propaganda, which merits a few reminders. The lessons, particularly about American intellectuals, are all too easy to recognize, though hardly ""inevitable.""
Uncontroversially, the Israel-Lebanon border was quiet for a year before the Israeli invasion, at least from Lebanon to Israel, north to south. Through the year, the PLO scrupulously observed a US-initiated ceasefire, despite constant Israeli provocations, including bombing with many civilian casualties, presumably intended to elicit some reaction that could be used to justify Israel's planned invasion. The best Israel could achieve was two light symbolic responses. It then invaded with a pretext too absurd to be taken seriously.
The invasion had nothing to do with ""intolerable acts of terror,"" though it did have to do with intolerable acts: of diplomacy. That has never been obscure. Shortly after the US-backed invasion began, Israel's leading academic specialist on the Palestinians, Yehoshua Porath - no dove -- wrote that Arafat's success in maintaining the ceasefire constituted ""a veritable catastrophe in the eyes of the Israeli government,"" since it opened the way to a political settlement. The government hoped that the PLO would resort to terrorism, undermining the threat that it would be ""a legitimate negotiating partner for future political accommodations.""
The facts were well-understood in Israel, and not concealed. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir stated that Israel went to war because there was ""a terrible danger... Not so much a military one as a political one,"" prompting the fine Israeli satirist B. Michael to write that ""the lame excuse of a military danger or a danger to the Galilee is dead."" We ""have removed the political danger"" by striking first, in time; now, ""Thank God, there is no one to talk to."" Historian Benny Morris recognized that the PLO had observed the ceasefire, and explained that ""the war's inevitability rested on the PLO as a political threat to Israel and to Israel's hold on the occupied territories."" Others have frankly acknowledged the unchallenged facts.69
In a front-page think piece on the latest Gaza invasion, NYT correspondent Steven Lee Meyers writes that ""In some ways, the Gaza attacks were reminiscent of the gamble Israel took, and largely lost, in Lebanon in 1982  it invaded to eliminate the threat of Yasir Arafat's forces."" Correct, but not in the sense he has in mind. In 1982, as in 2008, it was necessary to eliminate the threat of political settlement.70
The hope of Israeli propagandists has been that Western intellectuals and media would buy the tale that Israel reacted to rockets raining on the Galilee, ""intolerable acts of terror."" And they have not been disappointed.
It is not that Israel does not want peace: everyone wants peace, even Hitler. The question is: on what terms? From its origins, the Zionist movement has understood that to achieve its goals, the best strategy would be to delay political settlement, meanwhile slowly building facts on the ground. Even the occasional agreements, as in 1947, were regarded by the leadership as temporary steps towards further expansion.71 The 1982 Lebanon war was a dramatic example of the desperate fear of diplomacy. It was followed by Israeli support for Hamas so as to undermine the secular PLO and its irritating peace initiatives. Another case that should be familiar is Israeli provocations before the 1967 war designed to elicit a Syrian response that could be used as a pretext for violence and takeover of more land - at least 80% of the incidents, according to Defense Minister Moshe Dayan.72
The story goes far back. The official history of the Haganah, the pre-state Jewish military force, describes the assassination of the religious Jewish poet Jacob de Haan in 1924, accused of conspiring for an accommodation between the traditional Jewish community (the Old Yishuv) and the Arab Higher Committee. And there have been numerous examples since.73
The effort to delay political accommodation has always made perfect sense, as do the accompanying lies about how ""there is no partner for peace."" It is hard to think of another way to take over land where you are not wanted.
Similar reasons underlie Israel's preference for expansion over security. Its violation of the ceasefire on November 4, 2008 is one of many recent examples.
When Israel broke the June 2008 ceasefire on Nov. 4, Amnesty International reported that the June 2008 ceasefire ""has brought enormous improvements in the quality of life in Sderot and other Israeli villages near Gaza, where before the ceasefire residents lived in fear of the next Palestinian rocket strike. However, nearby in the Gaza Strip the Israeli blockade remains in place and the population has so far seen few dividends from the ceasefire. Since June 2007, the entire population of 1.5 million Palestinians has been trapped in Gaza, with dwindling resources and an economy in ruins. Some 80 percent of the population now depend on the trickle of international aid that the Israeli army allows in.""74 But the gains in security for Israel towns near Gaza were evidently outweighed by the felt need to deter diplomatic moves that might impede West Bank expansion, and to crush any remaining resistance within Palestine.
The preference for expansion over security has been particularly evident since Israel's fateful decision in 1971, backed by Henry Kissinger, to reject the offer of a full peace treaty by President Sadat of Egypt, offering nothing to the Palestinians - an agreement that the US and Israel were compelled to accept at Camp David eight years later, after a major war that was a near disaster for Israel. A peace treaty with Egypt would have ended any significant security threat, but there was an unacceptable quid pro quo: Israel would have had to abandon its extensive settlement programs in the northeastern Sinai. Security was a lower priority than expansion, as it still is.75
Today, Israel could have security, normalization of relations, and integration into the region. But it very clearly prefers illegal expansion, conflict, and repeated exercise of violence, actions that are not only criminal, murderous and destructive but are also eroding its own long-term security. US military and Middle East specialist Andrew Cordesman writes that while Israel military force can surely crush defenseless Gaza, ""neither Israel nor the US can gain from a war that produces  reaction from one of the wisest and most moderate voices in the Arab world, Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, who said on January 6 that `The Bush administration has left  a disgusting legacy and a reckless position towards the massacres and bloodshed of innocents in Gaza...Enough is enough, today we are all Palestinians and we seek martyrdom for God and for Palestine, following those who died in Gaza'.""76
One of the wisest voices in Israel, Uri Avnery, writes that after an Israeli military victory, ""What will be seared into the consciousness of the world will be the image of Israel as a blood-stained monster, ready at any moment to commit war crimes and not prepared to abide by any moral restraints. This will have severe consequences for our long-term future, our standing in the world, our chance of achieving peace and quiet. In the end, this war is a crime against ourselves too, a crime against the State of Israel.""77
There is good reason to believe that he is right. Israel is deliberately turning itself into one of the most hated countries in the world, and is also losing the allegiance of the population of the West, including younger American Jews, who are unlikely to tolerate its persistent shocking crimes for long. Decades ago, I wrote that those who call themselves ""supporters of Israel"" are in reality supporters of its moral degeneration and probable ultimate destruction. Regrettably, that judgment looks more and more plausible.
Meanwhile we are quietly observing a rare event in history, what the late Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling called ""politicide,"" the murder of a nation -- at our hands.78

And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same

But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

I tried to write your name in the rain
But the rain never came
So I made with the sun
The shade
Always comes at the worst times (Ah)

You ask me what I'm thinking about
I tell you that I'm thinking about
Whatever you're thinking about
Tell me somethin' then I'll forget
And you might have to tell me again
It's crazy what you do for a friend

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues

I keep on tryin' to let you go
I'm dyin' to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry, little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
You gotta let it out soon, just let it out

Go ahead and cry, little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
I know that you got daddy issues
And if you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too

If you were my little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I know that you got daddy issues, and I do too135Embed"

Telling myself I won't go there
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by pride and guilt

(Ooh) There's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) But I know I can't resist it
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from thе daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hatе it at the same time

Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end

Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight

La, la, la, la-la-la
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

ロマンチックな人生は諦めてたけど
周りはカップルばかりで
それを合図だと、受け止めるべきかな？
(Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)

寂しいよ
私を抱きしめてくれる恋人はいないかな
部屋に閉じこもって泣いちゃうよ
恋愛のことは疑心暗鬼になってしまう
それでももっともっと求めたくなるの

キューピッドにセカンドチャンスをあげたのに
今ここにいるのは惨めな自分
その愛は本物じゃないってわからせたいのに
キューピッドは本当に馬鹿なんだね

毎日彼からの矢を探してるんだ
迷子になったのか、どこかへ飛んでしまったのかな？
待ってはいられないよね
11月から待ち続けてたけど
愛することってそんなに良いのかな？

Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear-view

Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away, I still see you
With sunlight on your face in my rear viewSee Cigarettes After Sex LiveGet tickets as low as $28You might also like18Embed"
