0,Ed Sheeran - Shape of You,"352 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsΕλληνικάDeutschFrançaisItalianoالعربيةShape of You Lyrics
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go (Mm)
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow (Mm)
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (Mm)
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, ""Boy, let's not talk too much""
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date (Mm)
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (Mm)
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay (Mm)
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead

Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue, but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke-down car
And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar
And I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Baby, I like your style

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand

I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

(Kygo „It Ain't Me”)

Drei Jahre schon
Hab'n wir zusammen gewohnt
Deine Haut im Silberton
Hab'n so oft gelacht …
Smartphones sind populär
Doch für mich warst du viel mehr
War dein Akku auch mal leer
Gab ich dir neue Kraft …
Ich bin nichts ohne dich
Geld für 'n Neues hab' ich nicht
Bitte lass mich nicht im Stich
Wenn dein Display bricht!

Wer ist da und lässt mich abends besser schlafen?
Und wessen Klang weckt mich jetzt jeden Morgen auf?
Wie frag' ich meine Freunde dann, wo ich heute pennen kann?
Wer ist da und lässt mich abends besser schlafen?

Sie, sie ist einfach wirklich unbeschreiblich schön
Ich könnt' schwören, ich hätt' sie im Traum geseh'n
Ihre Kurven lassen mein Herz höher schlagen
Oh yeah, yeah
Äußerlich gesehen ist sie eine Zehn
Sie ist fast perfekt, es gibt nur ein Problem
Doch mir fällt kein Weg ein, ihr das nett zu sagen …

Sie ist dämlich!
Faselt unaufhörlich Schwachsinn und sie schämt sich
Nicht und ihre Ignoranz ist unerträglich
Ich will weg hier, denn jetzt dämmert mir allmählich:
Sie ist dämlich!
Sie und Einstein sind in keiner Weise ähnlich
Ihre Schönheit ist erwiesen, beinah sträflich
Doch im Oberstübchen scheint es leider kläglich

Wie kann ein so schönes Wesen nur so endlos hohl sein?
Hält die Speisekarte falsch rum
Sie kann doch nicht ganz bei Trost sein
Sie ist neuerdings vegan, darum bestellt sie Chicken
Zieht an Türen statt zu drücken
Ihre Gehirn besteht aus Lücken
Tollpatsch sein

Oh, yeah
Beinah täglich stoß' ich mir den Zeh
Das kann doch nicht sein, es tut richtig weh
Warum bin ich so ein Tollpatsch, hat da wer 'ne Idee?
Oh!
Die Herdplatte war ja noch höllisch heiß!
Ich brauche jetzt schnell mal kühlendes Eis
Man könnte fast sagen „Bad Karma”, ich weiß

Grade wieder den Kopf gestoßen
Und danach vom Longboard geflogen
Türklinken-Stromschock – das hat gezogen
Und das alles war erst heut – ungelogen
Uhh, das tat weh!
Ich hab' solche Schmerzen, solche Schmerzen

Da gibt's nix zu scherzen, nichts zu

Mein Statement an …
(Imagine Dragons „Believer”)

Hört gut zu
Was ich euch heute zu erzählen hab'
Die Sache, die ich hasse
Stört mich schon mein Leben lang, uh-uuh
Stört mich schon mein Leben lang, uh-uuh
Es betrifft
Nicht nur mich, sag mir nicht, Ich sei allein
Damit, dieser Hype!
Mann, das kann doch echt nicht sein, uh-uuh
Das kann doch echt nicht sein, uh-uuh

Man benutzt sie für die Lippen
Sogar beim Putzen – entzückend
Oder auch Schutz vor den Mücken
Universal, anwendbar, und sogar für das Haar
Farblich gibt's grün oder auch schwarz
Voll Vitamine für den Salat
Selbst im Martini – phänomenal
Doch meine Meinung dazu bleibt …

Bah!
Wer mag denn schon, wer mag denn schon Oliven, Oliven?
Bah!
Sie schmecken echt unglaublich schlecht, Oliven, Oliven?
Bah!
Sie sind unappetitlich ganz und gar

Oliven find' ich wirklich einfach

Bah!

Meine Allergie
(Kendrick Lamar „HUMBLE.”)

Will in mein Zimmer!
Draußen ist's schlimmer!
Wäääääh
Haa-tschu

Ey, hab' 'ne Fehlfunktion des körpereigenen Immunsystems
Nun reagiert es überempfindlich auf Pollen, außerdem
Denkt mein Körper jetzt, ich hab' ein gesundheitliches Problem
Dabei sind's harmlose Stoffe – Pollen sind ein Phänomen
Tabletten machen müde, kann dann nicht mal mehr gerade steh'n
Das Einzige, was wirklich was bringt, ist Duschen vorm Schlafengehen
Damit die Pollen nicht im Bett oder sogar am Kissen kleben
Und trotzdem wird dir morgen Wind die Pollen in die Fresse wehen
Wenn die Nase anfängt loszulaufen und man nie
Die Tränen in den Augen wegwischen kann, irgendwie
Juckt's dich am ganzen Körper, du kriegst Ausschlag und du niest
Dann bist du wie ich, Bruder, du hast Pollenallergie!
Hab auch Allergie gegen Äpfel …
Durch Luftverschmutzung wird es noch bekräftigt
Schocktherapie und die Heilpflanzen helfen echt nicht
Ohne Cortison wird's hässlich

Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

19,Luis Fonsi - Despacito (Featuring Daddy Yankee),"1 ContributorIs Music Really Haram? The Sad Reality of Today’s Music. LyricsIs Music Really Haram?
It’s the question almost everyone wants to argue about and the debate that never seems to end.
And before you drop the “Haram Police” card and get ready to prepare an essay response in the comments, can I just say that I’m not here to argue the different rulings and opinions on musical instruments, singing, beat boxing, drums and what not. I’m not even going to go there.
I’m going to be doing something different.
I want us to answer this question for ourselves, openly and honestly. In fact, we can even forget I even said the word Haram to begin with.
Let’s instead just ask the question “Is Music harmful?”
And when we say music, I’m going to be very blank, I’m referring to the music that the majority of people are listening to today because that’s what we should be concerned about. The music that’s on our radios, TV’s, phones and iTunes playlists on repeat. The songs that are topping the charts week-in-week-out and have us memorizing their lyrics from A-Z. This is the music I’m referring to.
Should we, as Muslims be fine listening to this stuff?
Well, let’s take a look for yourselves and decide.
The Hot 100 Billboard Charts has these songs topping the charts for the current week.

Despacito:
Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee Featuring Justin Bieber
“You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on”
Wild Thoughts:
DJ Khaled, Rhianna, Bryson Teller
“I don’t know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked”

That’s what I like:
Bruno Mars
“Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me”

I’m the One:
DJ Khaled, Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Quavo
“Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie”

Unforgettable:
French Montanna
“If you loved the girl then I’m so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
No, no I won’t tell nobody”
“If you want drama, Grab the Uzi”.

A quick Google search of the lyrics of these songs will let you know exactly the kinds of messages they contain. You honestly don’t have to read far until you come across references to drugs, sexual promiscuity, violence or alcohol. Even when lyrics can seem somewhat innocent, they are underlined with the most vulgar and shameless of meanings. And the saddest part of it all, there’s even some Muslims actually making these songs.
And yes, I’m sure we can argue all day that not all songs are this bad and there are some “good songs” out there, but the fact of the matter is the statistics speak for themselves when they mention that the vast majority of today’s music is riddled with such references and as the day’s go by content is only getting worse.
And as I’ve mentioned before, I’m not here to argue the Islamic rulings on instruments and the various opinions of scholars on music, because, in all honesty, these opinions are irrelevant when we consider them in light of the music being listened to today. I mean, do you seriously want to argue the permissibility of instruments when Muslims are listening to Nicki Minaj?
And we can go ahead and argue that we’re strong and that the music isn’t necessarily influencing us, but the fact of the matter is – it does. And whether you realize it or not, when you constantly grant such music free access to your ears, it is affecting you. It’s normalizing the worst of sins to the point we can sing about them happily and joyfully.
And if you were so sure that the things you listen to won’t affect your life, why not switch up a music playlist with some Quran and see what change it would have in your life. Even if you don’t understand a word being recited, just listen to it and see what kind of impact it will leave on your soul. There’s no denying that our ears are gateways into our hearts and we should be very careful who we allow access to.
And lastly, I know we all have shortcomings and weaknesses, and I know not all of us are the perfect ideal Muslims – but the least we can do is acknowledge that it’s wrong so that perhaps we can start making an effort to change.
May Allah help us all.Embed"

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?

When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

45,Lukas Graham - 7 Years,"231 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάالعربية7 Years Lyrics
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?

You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nosebleeds

Hold me hard and mellow

I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close tonight and always

So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day

Ich kann schwören, ich kann scherzen
Ich sage was ich denke
Wenn ich trinke, wenn ich rauche
Halte ich mit den Menschen mit
Und du siehst mich wie ich meinen Mittelfinger der Welt zeige
Scheiß' auf deine Maßstäbe und deinen Klunker
Denn ich bin nicht nur ein schönes Mädchen

Ich bin mehr als nur ein Foto
Ich bin eine Tochter und eine Schwester
Manchmal ist es schwer für mich zu zeigen
Dass ich mehr bin als nur ein Gerücht
Oder ein Lied auf deinem Computer
Da ist mehr als die Leute wissen

Manchmal bin ich blank, manchmal bin ich reich
Manchmal bin ich nett, manchmal kann ich eine Schlampe sein
Manchmal bin ich stark, manchmal gebe ich auf
Ich zeige es nicht, aber ich habe schon viel scheiße erlebt

Ich kann schwören, ich kann scherzen
Ich sage was ich denke
Wenn ich trinke, wenn ich rauche
Halte ich mit den Menschen mit
Und du siehst mich wie ich meinen Mittelfinger der Welt zeige

56,Ed Sheeran - Galway Girl,"109 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsGalway Girl Lyrics
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just wanna dance""

I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way

Oh, je suis seule
En solo jusqu’à ma mort
Parce que je ne compte que sur moi-même (ouais)
Oh, je n'ai pas besoin qu'on me tienne la main
Même quand la nuit est froide
J'ai cette flamme dans mon âme

Huh, et aussi loin que je puisse voir, j'ai juste besoin d'intimité
Avec un tas de weed, putain de modestie
J'ai juste besoin d'espace pour me reconstruire
Je donne au monde ce qu'ils cherchent à voir
Une Stella Maxwell à mes côtés
Une Ferrari, j'en achète trois
Un dressing de Saint Laurent, j'ai ce que je veux quand je veux
Parce que cet appétit me dirige ouais
J'ai juste besoin d'être seul j'ai juste besoin d'être à la maison
Comprend ce que je dis
Si le temps c'est de l'argent, j'ai besoin d'un prêt
Mais quoi qu'il en soit je continuerai d'avancer
J'emmerde les faux amis !
On ne subit aucune perte, on gagne juste des millions
Pendant que vous suivez, on créé des tendances
Je me remets au travail dès la pause est finie

J'ai besoin de rien (ouais) pour m'aider à passer la nuit

Ouais, ça me maintient en vie (maintien en vie)
Je n'ai besoin de rien d'autre pour être satisfaite
Parce que la musique me fait du bien
Et ça me fait ça à chaque fois

Ouais, et je n'aime pas parler pas aux étrangers
Alors lâche moi, je suis anxieux
J'essaie d'être cool, mais je peux vite partir en vrille
Je dis ""je vous emmerde tous"" devant vos têtes
Ça a bien changé maintenant je suis célèbre
Tout le monde sait combien ce style de vie est dangereux
Mais j'aime l'adrénaline que ça procure
On fait la fête toute la nuit et tout le monde se déchaîne
J'ai appris à gérer ma colère
Je nage dans l'argent
Je nage dans l'alcool, mon foie est malade
Mais ça va je sirote du champagne
Cette merde est géniale, cette merde est pas aléatoire, je n'ai jamais eu de chance
Je suis parvenu jusque-là parce que j'ai tout fait pour ça
Ils prennent tous l'argent pour acquis
Mais ils ne veulent pas travailler pour l'avoir - dis moi maintenant est ce que c'est drôle ?
Oh, je suis seule
En solo jusqu’à ma mort
Parce que je ne compte que sur moi-même (ouais)
Oh, je n'ai pas besoin qu'on me tienne la main

Parce que la musique me fait du bien et ça me fait ça à chaque fois

Ouais, pendant mes nuits de solitude, je reste éveillé
Je prie le Seigneur de prendre mon âme
Mon cœur est devenu trop froid pour être brisé
Je sais que je suis doué mais je suis fauché
Je rêve de liasses de billets
Toute ma vie on m'a dit d'être patient
Mais je vais agir maintenant, ouais il n'y a pas à discuter
Ouais
Oh, je suis seule
En solo jusqu’à ma mort
Parce que je ne compte que sur moi-même (ouais)
Oh, je n'ai pas besoin qu'on me tienne la main
Même quand la nuit est froide
J'ai cette flamme dans mon âme

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Another Smack back, I got a sucker to back smack

Enough shit talkin', time to talk shop
This 'bout to be so dome splittin' home slice
Ain't no cut on this thing but you're gettin' chopped
You gonna fall short every line clip and it stop
This here gon' be a clean take down, just play ball
From the tip, off wit' his head and then it drops
Damn Verb, look what you did what you did wit' ya shot
They gon' give me all the photo cred' but all I caught was the body...
Yeah some niggas don't get the picture 'til it's cropped
Top- layers they put you in, that's from all that bitchin' you do a lot
If you got through the tiers flippin', I should flop
Word Verb, you 'bout that action for traffic and then it stops
I'm a mind reader
You gon' be time keepin' the time keeper
This should've been unlimited but it's not
You'se a tricky nigga got 'em to get the clicker on paper put a hold (hole) on me like a ticket clipper
This what you picked, you forgot?
You was supposed to let the fans in Houston figure this out
Yeah I keep all the tweets from your Twitter account
Silly nigga, slippin', thought I was blocked
But you claim you a legend, well, you gotta walk that ""forever"" talk nigga
That infinite ain't a knot you can just put on ya belt yourself
If that ain't the extent of what you can rock it's not felt
Maybe for a song or two on the mic, cool, (Michael) Phelps
But you're swimmin' next to a yacht
These three minute round niggas, swearin' they gods
But ain't no limits to Jah
That's why fuck you nigga, I'ma keep tickin'
Forget the tock on that digital box
Niggas just wanna watch me come to work
As soon as I start to punch in, you ain't got to look over
You gon' know exactly what time it is when you gettin' clocked
Yeah, you cappin', just not cappin', captain
Just mismatchin' disses is a lot
Thought this was a cool move, hiccup, I'm the wrong dude you, slip dissin'
Can knock you bein' hip up out ya slot

I see you jumpin' the gun, right?
I'm like, ""Why would I take offense (a fence) to the hop?""
I let you leap, get him high

Just breathe nigga
Verb, what the A (Aye) for? Apron?
Nigga, are you a waitress?
Why you lay out how heavy the stakes (steaks) then
Already set the table of content so they mind's bent, outta great shape when
They go to step up and scale the lines, measure the body
Punches can't fit like a glove, cause you done laced it wit' the narration
See, some things you should make wait (weight)
He don't even let us get to the weigh-ins (Wayans)

I'm me, fuck you thought?
Eff who and how many, how 'bout some fights ain't meant to be fought
Now I'm in ya fort
Hit ya spot, big dance, spin ya top

You'se a flower pot
Why not throw some dirt on ya name?
This the thanks after I pitched you game?
Helped ya home base
Get to every card and all (Cardinal), y'all think it's because of the bol' pen (bullpen)?

Now suddenly I've been blessed with this divine energy
Lux...yo' level of comp ain't a- it it ain't a high level of comp'
It's standard, it what come wit' it nigga, it's complementary
Y'all Clark Kent is now in the face of a real villain
Tonight, I don't hear yo' raps, nah uh
I don't hear they claps
While you perform, I envision a slaughter for him
Wit' chainsaws goin' and pigs squealin'
All night I got these ill feelings
That's dedication
So what you crazy?
You still gon' get yo' crazy ass killed
I'ma sit you down crazy still...like a mental patient in meditation
What? We all know you ass/as
That's the definition of reputation
Stay woke, I'll make the creative mind of y'all Wes Craven appear cave men
Insane shit, I'ma murder you
Then preserve blood off the pavement for later so I can bathe in it
Cat Scan Beloved, I was amazed cause there's more afraid than rage in him
Never seen a saber tooth tiger behave kitten
Peel his cap back, open his skull it's a maze in it
I'm confused cause it ain't a way out or a way in it
You got a fake image
With a whisper of great gimmick
That's why yo' rhymes don't manifest in this world, they phase different
Until you let down yo' little guard, show us who you are, your full potential remains hidden
And that makes it easy for me to Blake Griffin over this caged pigeon
He told Hollow, ""Stand up niggas don't lean"", he way trippin'
But where I'm from, I guess we raised different
Cause we was taught, if it's a nigga you wanna smoke and he got shooters around him you smoke the shooters
Stand up niggas gotta lean once they crouch or they cane ('caine) missin'
You an open book for Verb, every round I'm page rippin'
Get off that dust and slam the breaks on all of this shape shifting
I am unlocked, herbal tea sippin', steel wit' a gun cock, let off one shot
Then the ringin' speed up like when ya phone block
Yeah son hot but I brought sunblock for this fuckin' kumquat
I've been wit' it, you been timid
You took the punk route
You scary like Ben Willis wit' the hook
But I'm scary, I'm Ben Simmons wit' a jump shot
I showed up here evolved, hair and all
Mixin' Farrakhan wit' fire in my eyes and no fear of God
Won't spare the wise
Binoculars look like the logo of the Ferragam'
Ain't water moccasins, these deep waters, this not the pond
You Transform for this, in my Prime I was Megatron
You look down on me
That crown too heavy on the head it's on
You can't see me, clearly he trippin' his mirror fogged
If he clip me the hood turns up Nipsy when hero's gone
Apollo Creed, I'd rather die in this ring than to leave knotted
A vegan versus everything 'Healthy', the fans came here to see a clean body
Had to take him out of his field, road game
Show the nigga how this feel
In his field, backstage his water be lightly chilled and distilled
I still, walk in and hit the faucet like this still
And you do is, ""You did this...you did that"", out there that's cold shit
To the midwest and down south niggas, to us that's hoe shit
So take yo' angle, whatever it is I can take yo' angle
I'm from the hood, God gotta make monsters, he don't make angels
The game been bias for you east coast Tri-State rhymers
Steady gassin', they ain't fans they was highway drivers
I say fire, they stay silent and make you irate kinda
I chase you down, time to kill, this is when I play Meyers
Price rate rises, later, when I vibrate higher
I don't tread light, in my mind I'm on five great tires
This is high grade china
Then you snort it I'ma find great China
King Kong ain't worried 'bout a primate fighter
In dark places nigga, I straight light up
I make lightenin', I break titans
Y'all see sensei, nigga I see slices
All night I'ma be straight brutal
You are special Lux, but when God made you special
He made a mistake and He made two of us
You ain't shit to me
Just another one of the numerous I done chewed up
I ain't humorous
Jokes don't get told at you nigga's funerals
I'm powerful
This flow out the mud, yo' shit malleable
I make Blain Brown's look Bartholomew
You the root of this culture?
Pssst, nigga I'll knock tree bark outta you
Bein' out my element is being in my element, this shit is odd to you
I never bow my head, I'm an odd ball
I go to war and never throw my towel in
You don't never take yo' towel off
Every time I saw you I told you ""sound off""
Whatchu do? You throw jabs but write (right) first like a southpaw
It's 'bout to get hot early, you didn't see yo' shadow groundhog
Doctor wit' the pen, if you a doctor it depends
When niggas sick you call off, I pull up, I make house calls
I'm a stand still, backflip nigga
Before yo' backflip you need a round off
Silencers take the sound off
I never touch the surface, I piss the ground off
Tonight we separate the Pitbulls from the house dogs
Fuckin' house dog
I said look
If I slay you...it's a no brainer
You even graze me, you famous
But what they pay me to do?
It's a contract to walk in ya house and cave in ya roof
Move
This shit don't take a lot of wit
He don't gotta win, that's the truth
In his mind, ""I got Lux I got Mook, shoot. I'm already in
How y'all not convinced, look what I'm against.""
This is a feast
Ya eyes on the prize for him
Is bein' in the belly of the beast, the bottom of the pit
I work, he's into wishin' (intuition)
That's a gut feelin'
When a nigga know he gotta die just (digest) to be the shit
I'm gon' do my duty though, I'm gon' do my duty
Hold up, they givin' mental midgets to genius giants
I'm cosmic, that's why this nigga's scared
For him it's conscious heavy, meddling (metaling) wit' a nigga you know rockin'
Ahh, both sockets watchin'
Ya heart pumpin' in a circle jumpin'
But he know who to rave about
And I'm 'bout to make it gothic
For a punk, you couldn't even stomp wit' me in a mosh pit
I'm Godsent nigga
Yo, yeah I know it's that way
But this is Lenny Kravitz, riffin'
You bitchin'
My background vocals is Princess Jasmine
Keep wishin'
I'm Will Smith then
I came to make a movie and it's a classic
Wit' a casket
Cause son, you don't know how many box offers (office) I had to put a lad in (Aladdin)
It's 'A Whole New World', nigga
This ain't back when you was rappin' wit' Hollow
You might be Showtime, just not at The Apollo, nigga
You know how I know?
Last year you could've got ate (8)
They told me, ""Wait""
I said, ""Cool it's N.O.M.E. it's fine.""
Fuck is Verb? I could've battled anybody and headlined
But you know when you know it's time
All these gun bar niggas on the card, but you can bet Smack still call Lux to fully Load this .9
And I'ma blow ya mind wit' it
I'm so on the money wit' this shit
Smack had the grand champ his grands
For this pussy, the tongue lashing to the T, I Rex these bitches
But got the belt fixin' 'em, I'm still handy man
Ya stance nigga, you don't stand a chance
When you St. Louis niggas pop out, I think Nelly albums
Soccer moms
Family vans
You know, the good stuff
'Til you gotta watch one of they community leaders gettin' put in the trunk for tryin' to lift his hood up
That shit rougher than mechanic hands
Man, I be, ""Damn.""
All this work, they got me up here tryin' to be a lazy nigga
Put my kid in park not playin' wit' him
The complications
Yo bro, you're not contemplatin'
The gang of differences you got
He can't see (C) it bein' (B'in), I'm what's crackin' blood vessels in this nigga's mental block
I'm key
Nigga, I be star trackin' (Star Trek-ing), grapplin', space travel
You can't anchor from a shippin' dock
""Aye aye captain.""
Nigga, you are so not on board
I'm like a whole 'nother type of craftsman
I mean, I ain't tryin' to hold V up, but this is Spock nigga
This is top doggin', tip top shape, kay?
With the drop on against the opp'
Good riddance (writtens), what did you jot?
I mean, cause you asked for this, oh did you not?
And won't he do it?
I'm such a smart ass, well I'm goin' stupid
But it's 'bout to have you starin' in this idiot box
This exclusive, no
This ya wake- up, the whole St. Louis
Heard I was ringin' this nigga bell, he can't hear the music
Live from Houston
Look, ya wife 'bout to find out you got a whole 'nother family at this Pay Per Viewing, nigga
Won't he do it?
I told y'all Mook care for ya
So there's no confusion, this is Houston, right?
And nigga you got a problem
For years, they done did your wave so greasy to the point you can't brush it off
Now you pickin' out different culminations cause I, hear you was growin', knowin' you wanna cut ya loss (locks)
Talkin' 'bout extension, Nina, you gon' put yo' bitch weave in
What next? You gonna run salons?
Cause ain't nobody here (hair) thinkin' you 'bout to bang bitch, who you puttin' this front up for, nigga?
I'm gonna do what it do whatever one you sport nigga
These sons of butchers
It's all in the battle for this, we lookin' at how your moms at
When a bitch nigga think they gotcha number
Turns out they just takin' contact, nigga
Let's combat
Ayo ARP!
Aye Verb runnin' prolly
Ay, give little nigga his heart back
It ain't his fault that, he didn't know, you should've hollered at a real hit man (Hitman)
Would've told him, ""What happens to killers who don't honor they contracts, nigga?""
Aye Hitman now that's a rap you should've remixed nigga
Rap-rap you should've remixed nigga
But instead of put him on track, you just skipped the fact
Or tellin' this vegan, ""Aye man, this might be the wrong time to be givin' chicken back man.""
Especially, everybody else can see
You went at Mook about his leadership skills
But didn't Yung Ill follow you when you misled ya grief?
Where he could've fed his peeps
If not got the check at least, still kept his integrity
But noooo, damn you handled that unprofessionally
This nigga out here chasing licks and takin' licks
The fuck can you teach us about some legacy, nigga?
""I'm a dawg"", dude nigga we see your pedigree
I got the message he tapped in, that's Morse Code
When the thirsty nigga gets spoon fed until the fork in the road
That's a turnoff
And I'ma pull up like skkkkkert
""Aye look here nigga. First off
This is Offset talkin' to Quavo 'bout a bad ad lib, yeah
You see right here, is when you gonna have to take that skirt off.""
Nigga man up!
(I can't wait 'til y'all rewind all this. Fuck outta here nigga.)
You got drugged all this way to be up here lookin' like you usin'
I'm crackin' this nigga head, I had to Whitney a nigga in Houston, man
You know what?
You'se a waste of my motherfuckin' time nigga
(And you're cuttin' into your mother's fuckin' time!)
Nooooo!
I wouldn't even touch ya moms nigga
'Healthy' nigga
Aye, round of applause for Lux puttin' us on y'all
{Claps}
That's where it stops
I won't bow
So you can miss me wit' that kung-fu guru Bru' shit
One of yo' fans told me, ""Verb you can't fuck wit' Lux
His style's so unique
He's so fast he can catch a bullet in his teeth.""
How fuckin' neat?
But I ain't here to throw hands and feet bitch
Nigga this an execution, play ball
Three minute rounds
(They ain't book me for a long time
Fuck a preview, let's let that beef brew, in 3D too
So it's Showtime!)
Put some bread on him like a stock exchange
Directions read, ""Lots of pain""
Picture, open heart like a locket chain
I've been watchin' Bane
Ride up, rockets bang from a proper range
He terrified, swervin', spinnin' the wheel like he Dr. Strange
I'm not for games
I live for this smoke, I breathe a different air, this isn't fair
Verb leavin' beef bloody, is it rare?
This shit practice, I've been to the finals so I'm prepared
Even in practice, miss a wide open shot you hit the stairs
The lights on me, but they never not on me, so I don't care
I got the glow so standin' next to me hoe, you just a glare
Boy you barely make sense like workers with prison shares
I can't let you live behind them bars, you get the chair
They happy that you back, I don't give a care
You ran so long, I'm sorry I can't clap when that ribbon tears
Listen here, where I'm from I dap all of the tigers and kiss the bears
It's a jungle, you couldn't hop lilypads or ribbit there
You and your staff's in the air and you flicker flares
On the island of fear you buy rental shares, I won't even visit there
I'm talkin' to your soul, where you goin'?
""Hey how you get up there?!""
Amazing the body dies alone but the mind and the soul it lives in pairs
Wait, I ain't woke, I'm just aware
I wasn't worried 'bout the win/loss, I was more indecisive 'bout what to wear
Nigga yeah
We watched Mook cook you he did it torch like
He put you out the house, I said, ""Come home"", let on the porch light
Open the door like gave you a hug tight
""I missed you. While you was gone the game ain't stop like playin' Fortnite.""
I got that master room now nigga, see what that floor like
Arguin' will leave to stabs like what rappers used to record like
On this stage boy I throw hard rights
And caught charges assault like
When you on the court Mike we ain't worried 'bout you Bill Cartwrights
Yo' kind of pressure, goin' to Flex hopin' yo' flow tight
My pressure, puttin' the town on my neck hopin' court go right
My method J. Cole like
But my jab and my sidestep pro like
Education and street ethics I need both like
Gotta motivate myself to go right
Nigga's round me sellin' dope, I'm chasin' 30 for a show and they makin' 7 every slow night
What you write, it ain't food for the thought
I won't buy, it won't register
Get that shit out my cart, that shit you sayin' is soft
You ain't shit but the Super Saiyan to marks
I don't see great, not a spark, just filet wit' a fork
Cause at yo' house you gotta pay here to park, Lux I'ma take you apart
Take any girl that you want and play wit' her heart
String her along like I'm playin' a harp
You ain't a champ, you a chump
I press gangsters you be playin' on punks
I get knocked out I'm back outside, boy you stay in for months
We ain't the same boy, you so funny
You ain't killed Verb you ain't killed nobody
I'll hold the barrel to my head for you, dare you to smoke something and won't even think to make a Go Fund Me
Take some notes from me
Yo' ancestors was prolly hidin' in forests
On my end, my origin is Mayan warriors
Cut off my head bitch I might grow four of 'em
Power up in the same motion, niggas play the accordion
Look how I talk to y'all Morpheus
When I came in this game I sent you rappers a message
I said, ""Forward 'em""
You niggas scared to bite that formula
Investors came and they liked my formula
Told Smack, ""For this business to flourish you need less of them niggas and more of him.""
Yo' sister get you artist's bruh, I never viewed Caine, no Michael Kor' in us
But baggin' is like the norm to us
The Big Apple your core audience, I know your coordinates
They line up memorials every time I fly in LaGuardia
Lie in Astoria, write his whole story up
I got coroners concealed in ya corner, this ain't no war wit' Lux
Cause afterwards we dap like ""Good performance""
Have a drink and we'll watch tears runnin' down yo' face each time you pour it up
I hate a nigga that act all innocent, you a fraud
Head on I face all my blemishes
I got God like energy but the Devil still enemy
For the Buck I be sittin' behind mirror tint
But the clip longer than Mirotic, it won't feel wrong a little bit
Your arch nemesis, authentic with all sentences
Part Schindler's List
Smoke cancerous carcinogens
You get killed on some Hitler shit
Rhythm arithmetic
Dark energies and whispers from dark entities
Your luck ran out Beloved
No matter how much you search and try to clover find
This Final Destination and death can only give closure is when you close yo' eyes
A humble king, I'm such a noble guy
I'ma take time and sign and notarize every Polaroid of you get pulverized
In yo' mind, you got a house on the hill and the holy skies
So you look down and throw black cloud around the trap house niggas like it ain't dope inside
Yeah, who you foolin' boy? I know ya kind
I'll smack blood in yo' mouth, you'll spit out a rainbow and ya roll yo' eyes
You a maggot, and a maggot at a maximum only grows to flies
Rewind yours and it's more to find
Yeah, rewind mine and get horrified I'm borderline immortalized
You look good in front of these punks but in front of all your kind you normalized
You better pick who you war wit' and choose yo' armor wise

We should've never gave this nigga no rap press
Goddamn it, granted you access at best this was dangerous
I mean you came in hittin' guardian angels, ya aim was high
Creatin', thought you was fly, then why the divine deflation?
It was always in ya nature, the migration
You soiled on new soil then got disloyal to the vibration
Now the drive's payments
New arrangements
You pop up with Chase chasin' fat checks
I gotta fact check a nigga who fakin'
You used to be crazy with his imagination
Turned padded wall weightless
What I mean is all you got now is the patience (patients)
The mental issue placed in ya psyche a situation
But if you think it's cool, cool
Yeah, wack, he (wacky) know it and I don't jack it (jacket), let's get it straightened
I coined phrases for this paper, face it, we seen your make up
You go do a thousand interviews tryin' to spin a move in ya favor
I bring cold rounds to the ring thinkin' a killer comin' to ice me, they give me a figure skater, man
I am the greatest
Cause solely only my pen is aided the opinionated when they debate it
But at least we can say this
I liked ya better wit' the perm nigga
Cause at least that dude (due) had his head on straight then
Now it's, ""Hey sis"", ""Sweetness""
But ain't nothin' about you Equal, I see you
The  think it's entertainment
The brainless herd, don't know everything they heard from you is to sway 'em
That's why I give it to these niggas, word for word I Verb bait him (verbatim)
Nigga thank me later
If you on the outside lookin' in
This is Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood again
When the pops younger than the son
But this my house and I gotta whoop him in
Status is what he mad at
Verb don't hate Loaded Lux nigga
He just hate the fact I remind him of what you could've been
Get at me
I'm old school, like big Caddy's and Ms. Haddie
Trina you can't Trick Daddy
Word get back we heard, I got that idea from your third wit' Hitman, whatchu say?
But if you made that a hot line and I made it a Hit then Man okay
I'll take that, we impact, you just graze
After me, no disrespect but Slim shit just wasn't the same
As for you, your man out here Wild 'N Out
Who might I add is a better position than you today
You runnin' 'round gettin' caught tryin' to get a plate
You'se a fool I pity pat him
Verb is a poker, he did the same shit with Cassidy
He'll try ya hand just to get on the card, how y'all don't see the deal at play?
Maybe your fans like you preyin' on niggas, thinkin' you a fake
What I got? You say six of them thangs?
But 9 times outta 10 when you see me on screen
All that shit be real I say
I bet every time you jumped in the ring cause you got a bill to pay
That's the difference Aye, curve
Beasley and them turned the curb
Put you back on the bus after being backstage gettin' your respect backhanded, Double Impact-ing you sluts
Y'all Cardinal cappin' bruh
What I mean is, you diss ARP but just like a bird for the low go (logo) back to the nigga that was smackin' you up
But act like you tough
I got a contest for the hard pressed
Cause I really think you got superiority complex
That's how you can say your baby moms is the best but you cheat on her
Unfaithful nigga
Out here hittin' females; lady killer
I think you bitter
Somewhere in ya mind I think every time a woman made you mad you saw that babysitter
Now, there's no question she molested you, so this part for you may be filler
You know, try to block it out, and I feel ya
But they came a long way to here about your ways how I get in ya way cause you never healed up
Look bruh, this the light fixture
Don't see the negatives when this hit ya main frame (mainframe) it
I'm just tryin' to give you the large picture, nigga
For the listeners, I'm givin' you symptoms
I'm sure you want Verb always playin' the victim
Even when he winnin' feelin' like everybody against him
Showtime
I wanna give you what he hides
Here's somethin' recently that he tried
Yo Calicoe!
How 'bout when it's real and it rhyme, nigga
Now no online, we actually had phone calls to get this battle done
On the line, no middle man
That mean I got your number and you got mine
Fast forward, all I asked you for was more time
I can see you said, ""Nah"", and then I said, ""Why?""
And then let you tell it I whined
And I was tryin' to just get my wage  denied
And I took to Twitter like some people we know
Now pointing any elbows ahhhh
But I...at least then I could see how ya moves were justified
But outta nowhere this nigga just pops up on PSA Radio
I'm like, ""This guy.""
Now whatever dudes he let the Tom Cruise
With me, I get a whole Minority Report and I didn't even commit no crime
I'm like, ""Woooow.""
Nigga, what triggered in ya mind that you was bein' victimized?
Truthfully, was it pride?
Or the prize
You saw it as an opportunity to get the critics on ya side
Ayo lil' bro, when we hit 'em like twice that 
 Both times
 Right
 And you let it ring to voicemail nigga
 Am I lyin'?
 
 Cause I knew you looked at it and just didn't accept the call nigga, and that's fine
Geechi Gotti voice tho'
 You'se a bitch!
 Cause at least I could've respected him more if you hit ""decline"", nigga
Beasley called your phone, no answer
I called ya phone no answer nigga
These is sensitive times
But you got time, to pop up on PSA Radio...again, workin'...at the job
Here it is, I can't get a lousy extra two minutes but you can take 30 of 'em and turn a simple ""no"" into a blog
That's on God nigga
It's always summertime and the living is easy
You're spoiled
Where the Aye Verb fans at?
{Crowd cheers}
Yeah, you'se a sucker too nigga
No expirin', but you make sure on the low, you tell 'em in the comments nigga, every round I was firin'
But don't be mad, JayBlac is hirin', my nigga
If you don't take nothin' else from my story, this part you should
Aye Verb, I'm a long way from home nigga
But so far so good, nigga

Aye, you know what thing I like about you New Yorkers?
Absolutely nothing
But I do like how y'all all got this ability to sell some fake shit and make people buy it
Pardon me Beloved
I'm sorry I'm not impressed
Tonight, the whole time while you was rhymin', this the scene in my head that I was visualizin'
""Aye my man I got these gold chains fresh off the train. They come from the island
Shop wit' me black man. I get 'em to you for less than value.""
See where y'all from, y'all pride yourself wit' bein' grimy
So anything they show you look good on the surface but look inside it?
You see the clouds in the stones but to the naked eye it looks stylish
Let me be honest
Lux you got this fake jewel droppin' shit down to a science
But you ain't shit but Cubic zirconia cut like a diamond it's extra shiny
Riddle me this
How do you stop a lyric driven nigga from lookin' godly?
You've got to bomb him
Give a conscious rapper a bald head and make him look like he Common
Let that marinate
Grey Hoodie Lux, stop tryin'
You can't go from Black Panther walkin' on water to back slidin'
Is you kiddin' me?
You think you can just diddy bop through the Bayou?
And the crocs ain't gon' show you they teeth and gators won't try you?
Where you from, niggas gas yo' shit wit' a match behind it
But that's what make you to a grown ass sucker, they're pacifying
No pressure writin', this shit from soul, never inspired, I just smoke
Cause it crack my head open to crack the hydrant, I let it flow
Y'all be deep but none of you niggas vikings
I'm Moses, just me and a stick ain't a staff like it
No promo for this good rappin' homo, not even basic chatter
Pull out ya casket I'ma make it shatter
Ogh, I make it matter if you make me madder
Pull out yo' suit I'ma turn the pastor into Casper in Stacy Adams
Let's shake this ladder
This ain't no fight cause I don't taste my plasma
The cloth I'm from they don't make this fabric
Fuck how I'm snappin', I get to slashin'
And make a wicker basket out you bastard
I'm a tyrant with the method of pirates
Sprinkle some violence, it's sickening
And this when I go viral off that virus
Astral project
Close eyelids, time roll backwards
Walkin' a thin line through both dimensions you need tight rope practice
Yo heat ain't shit, I had meditation sessions in Cairo with a 
And you hot I'm cold
Hot and cold make cyclones happens
Stars are lining (aligning) back up for me; chiropractor
Sheep in yo' blood
That's why you fold you got the gyro factor
I got that pyro factor
I walk off stage and leave a light show after
I'm not like most rappers
I be patient, toe tappin' a finger pop just like white folks snappin'
Different drive, different vehicle
Yeah he a ghost, but I'm a rental Kia car with a trunk full of a quarter ki of coke
I'm what the streets need the most
Every time I shower now don't even need the soap
Nigga I'm an animal, it's only right I walk around and reek of GOAT
The loser gotta jump, therefore if we tie and they can't call it
We both go to the top of the buildin' and stand on it
Take a leap, as I stare at the street to land on it
You'll be smilin' the whole time cause you wearin' a damn harness, you fuckin' scam artist
I'm outside wit' it like homeless people
Fuck the stage, we could've threw it on the block like Marcin Gortat in the post with Oladipo
See I came to take yo' best shots, see I don't come to weave 'em
I gotta see if this legend true about you punchin' people
All of the moments he froze and all the weak nigga's components he shows
This been a cheat code for Mr. Lomachenko and it's when all his chinks show
{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}
St. Louis nigga, fuck ya crown I'ma turn all my teeth gold
Your body I'ma bring it back boy I'm wit' all the repos
See I'm a player but still a part of me coach
I tell myself, ""Long as I hit the game winners I can miss all the free throws.""
I bleed out and get my arteries sewn
And when I die nigga my heart'll be cloned and every part of sold
Yeah you found us
But you ain't tryin' to build us from the ground up
You was tryin' to find some food for ya monsters
Goodz, ICE, Arsonal, so you fish in small ponds, out of towners lookin' for flounders
But you picked the wrong fish motherfucker I'm a piranha
You remember back in New York City that time you brought us?
I was hungry, survivin' off hunger without a dollar
I was in my baby mama crib, nigga just had a toddler
I was tryin' to be the best while forgettin' to be his father
When it rains it pours, my life's scattered showers like every hour
When you pass away, you gon' be known as a cold coward
Use that gift God gave you or He gon' take back yo' power
People tell you that you great, you don't even comment
How you gon' turn yo' nose up at the people that's tryin' to hand you yo' flowers?
It ain't just you, we all bring somethin' to the table, it's like a potluck
Either play by the rules or get outta this shit nigga, this is our stuff
When you die you gon' be born again
You was a little chicken in this realm, you gon' be reincarnated a Cornish hen
When I wrote this shit my eyes turned scarlet red and I scarred my hands
Party's over, end of the night bitch, c'mon let's dance
Dunk contest, picture this the opening round
I do a 360 from the dots and I get high off the ground

There's no promise that I won't keep

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time (Time, time) to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, oh)
Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

We're stressed out (Out, out, out, out)

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

I woke up pissed off today
And lately, everyone feels fake
Somewhere, I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
I'll be loud for you

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you

Cause I feel like I’m always dreaming (One, two, three, four!)
Cause I feel like I’m always dreaming

Sometimes I tend to lose myself when I’m out here on my own
I never seem to get it right, but I guess that’s how it goes
Ever since you came around, can’t nobody hold me down
You showed me how to find myself when I needed it the most

I been up all night, no sleep (What?)
Cause I feel like I’m always dreaming
All night, no sleep (London!)
Cause I feel like I’m always dreaming
Wide awakе, that’s okay, as long as I’m with you
I’ll be up all night, no sleep
Cause I feel like I’m always drеaming
Cause I feel like I’m always dreaming

I’m never gonna find my way
If I don’t run to that goal
The past is the past, today is today
And there’s things I can’t control
The circles underneath my eyes
Tell the truth that I've been trying to hide
I’ve been waiting for you way too long
Won’t you come and take me home
Oh I, I’m praying this ain’t all a dream

Trapped in our white picket fence

So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb

And party on

Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one's on me

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like ""Who would you live for?"" ""Who would you die for?""
And ""Would you ever kill?""

I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alarm without no warning
You're by my side and we've got smoke in our lungs

Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say, “Love, baby, let’s go back to my flat”
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that
I got a reason, so man, put that record on again

I don't wanna hear sad songs anymore
I only wanna hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don’t wanna sing mad songs anymore
Only wanna sing your song
'Cause your song's got me feeling like I’m

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
Yeah, you know, your song's got me feeling like I'm

No fear but I think I'm falling, I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run (Oh)
No risk so I think I’m all-in
When I kiss your lips, feel my heartbeat thump (Oh)

I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I know everybody on this island seems so happy
On this island, everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go

97,Calvin Harris - Feels,"178 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschEspañolFeels Lyrics
Hey!
Now nothing ever last forever, no
One minute you're here and the next you're gone
So I respect you, wanna take it slow
I need a mental receipt to know this moment I owe

And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you?
To memorize the way you shock me
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

Don't be afraid to catch feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Hey)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Feels with me

I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh
I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality
It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar
As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity
See Calvin Harris LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like
And do you mind if I steal a kiss? (Chop, chop)
A little souvenir, can I steal it from you? (Oh, yeah)
To memorize the way you shock me (Zap)
The way you move it here (Hey)
Just wanna feel it from you (Hey)

Don't be afraid to catch feels (Ha)
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (Hey)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels (Straight up)
Feels with me (Woah)

Goddamn, I know you love to make an entrance
Do you like getting paid or getting paid attention?
You mixed the wrong guys with the right intentions
In the same bed, but it still feel long distance
She's looking for a little more consistency
But when you stop looking, you gon' find what's meant to be
And honestly, I'm way too done with the hoes
I cut off all my exes for your x and o's
I feel my old flings was just preparing me
When I say I want you, say it back, parakeet
Flyin' first-class through the air, Airbnb
I'm the best you had, you just be comparing me to me
I'ma 'at' this at you, if I put you on my phone
And upload it, it'll get maximum views
I came through in the clutch with the lipsticks and phones
Wear your fave cologne just to get you alone
Don't be afraid to catch feels
Don't be afraid to catch these feels
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Yeah)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (I know)
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels
Woah, woah, woah
Feels with me
Don't be afraid to catch feels (No, no)
Don't be afraid, baby
Ride drop top and chase thrills (Woah, okay)
I know you ain't afraid to pop pills
I know, I know, I know, I know
Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels

For the longest time we jamming at the party
And you're whipping on beat
Pushing everything on me
We got Silentó on repeat
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
Better change your mind
The Henny got me feeling right
You're going home with me tonight

Let me hold you, girl, caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on
Let me jam you, girl whip all around me
You got me going crazy
You turn me on, turn me on

Turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on

For the longest time, you're staring like you want me
I can feel your eyes
So go tell your friends goodbye
We can make our way outside
If they think they're gonna stop you coming with me
Better change their minds
The Henny got us feeling right
You're going home with me tonight
