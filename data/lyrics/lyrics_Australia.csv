Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June

Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you

1,The Killers - Mr. Brightside,"231 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisDeutschMr. Brightside Lyrics
Comin' out of my cage, and I've been doin' just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're goin' to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Uh
Yeah, yeah

When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (yeah)
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets of a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the seat
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

You used to meet me on the Eastside

Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Half our friends are now are enemies
Now I-, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me

You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside
You used to meet me on the Eastside

But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years

Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?

Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

In all the good times, I find myself longin'

And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryna fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling
In all the good times, I find myself longing
For change
And, in the bad times, I fear myself

Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (Star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta ('Sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas ('Tas)
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta (Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('Son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (Car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" (Ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?

Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

And four years, no calls
Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar

So, baby, pull me closer

Pull the sheets right off the corner

With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Woah)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away

But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To be young and in love in New York City
To not know who I am but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City
Midnight into morning coffee, burnin' through the hours talking
Damn

I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time, I'd stay for a long time, 'cause
I like me better when, I like me better when I'm with you

I don't know what it is but I got that feelin'
Wakin' up in this bed next to you swear the room, yeah, it got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking, I might have to tell you somethin'
Damn

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

You better lose yourself in the music

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music

I hear the drums echoing tonight
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation
She's comin' in, 12:30 flight
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
I stopped an old man along the way
Hopin' to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say
""Hurry, boy, it's waiting there for you""
It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
There's nothin' that a hundred men or more could ever do
I bless the rains down in Africa
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
Ooh, hoo

The wild dogs cry out in the night
As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company

As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
I seek to cure what's deep inside
Frightened of this thing that I've become

59,Bryan Adams - Summer Of '69,"62 ContributorsSummer of ’69 Lyrics
I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five and dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69

Me and some guys from school
Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I should've known we'd never get far

Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
I spent my evenings down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, yeah

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothing can last forever
Forever, no

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six-string
I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that it'd last forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah

The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better than the summer
Of 2002 (Ooh)

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)

Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' ""bye, bye, bye""

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Hidin' somewhere in the night

Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
Oh-oh

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down

68,Oasis - Wonderwall - Remastered,"1 ContributorShotty Horroh vs. Shuffle T Lyrics
When I say ""long life"" you say, ""Pat Stay""
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Long Live
(Pat Stay!)
Some said I wasn't gonna-
(Show up, that's what the talk was about
But I show up to the showdown
To show off when the show's on for all of the crowd!)
Shuffle T
Haha...fuckin' he
""I like to talk about multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
Stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause you got this humongous-
Shuffle T
Haha...fuckin' he
""Oh I wrote the book on multisyllabic rhymin' patterns. Look at me!""
You fuckin' geek
You stay up for a couple weeks?
A month at least, you probably couldn't sleep
I guess, tryin' to think of everything that rhymes with...everything must come with some degree of pullin' teeth
You tellin' Marlo you can't go to his fox hunt retreat
Cause of this humongous heap of things that rhyme with ""wannabe""
Tellin' Rowan you're not goin' to battle in some fuckin' club in Leeds
On Don't Flop ""Hustlin' It Free"" cause you got an upcoming book release
And I congratulated him like, ""You wrote a book? What an amazing guy.""
When you hear he wrote a book your thoughts go to some of our greatest minds
I said, ""What's your book about? Space and time?
Ancient tribes?
The economic crisis as we sit back and watch inflation rise
No, no, no, it's a novel, something more on the creative vibe
No, conspiracy theories
Children of The Matrix vibe
David Icke
Please, tell me the subject you're takin' with this publication, cause I cannot take the hype
He looked me dead in the face, and right
He said, ""I wrote a book about complicated rhymes.""
""Complicated rhymes?!""
""Yeah. Multisyllabics
They absolutely have to be done when you rap to the punch of it like
Plus the grammatical structure and pattern needs a straight function and fashion
But I'll allow for slight discrepancies depending on the native tongue of the accent but that does come with an asterisks
And...you know...you know...who needs to kiss a girl?
That's stuff just a distraction, I don't need direct sunlight or a shower. None of it
Why would I go to a club and get plastered
When I can stay at home, figure out the number of attractors
And sift through my rejection emails to see if the publishers haven't told me I need to- told me I need to be fuckin' embarrassed?""
I'm joking
He's kissed a girl before
Have you kissed a girl before?
He's kissed a girl before
In fact, Shuffle and his ex just finalized a fuckin' divorce
Bitch wrote the man a rhyme for Valentines and he told her her multi's were forced
The man even pointed a score
Give her just under a four
She laughed it off
""Oh my Adam it's funny for sure.""
But he said she should've known better she did something he just couldn't ignore
Especially now he's booked in the store so he doesn't love her no more
Fuckin' run for the door
Fuckin' guy
Awkward as fuck, walkin' like he's got a wooden spine
Doesn't let you sing ""Happy Birthday"" to him because it doesn't rhyme
Wore his weird fuckin' trench coat a 100 times
Got you lookin' like you come disguised
As a cunt that likes the under 5's
Nonce!
Wore it so many times he doesn't need to hang up his coat
He hasn't washed it in years
He takes it off and it stands on it's own
That coat is alive
It's symbiosis
It demands the controls when attached to a host
I saw him put his hand inside said jacket, and it actually moaned
""Oooh yeah.""
""Oooh ye-""
Either it's been the same jacket for 10 years or you got ten on a rack on a special stack like Dexter's Lab
Each of 'em have a tiny pocket which contains a microscopic list of all the sex you've had
That coat screams, ""Why does she never text me back?""
So dirty every time he wears it his neck gets chapped and his flesh is cracked with a reddish rash
I gave him a hook last week and my leg was scratched
I had to get a 
Fuck that coat!
I've never known anything to smell as bad, it gets me mad
When I see it, it makes me wanna Jet like a Pepsi ad for collecting cans
That one's for the Netflix fans, you get me gang?
Baow!
That's my first round in, safe star blessed
I've got two more rounds and plenty more space in my graveyard left!

Everybody’s been, telling me I won’t ever survive my next foe
I was never alive, been sentenced to life, they sent me to fry at death row
They’ve already supplied some fresh clothes, the burial site, the headstone
I’m dead on arrival, end of the line, but ready to die, so let’s go!
That’s why I’ve drafted a will…
Now I'd like Sounds Like to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro
And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat
And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price’s bedpost
And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for Death Note
Because I’m battling Shotty Horroh – yeah?
The genius
I mean it
In Manchester, this guy is Jesus
I am in utter shock, I'm giddy – in pieces
Underprepared best man...I’m speechless
They said, ""Shotty’s back to battling, it’s just like the olden days.""
Couldn’t believe it “God’s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades”
Well fuck it I’m back, too
What’s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle
Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl
But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly
He called it off… I’m like, ""What? But mate, you promised me.""
I asked if it’s still happening, he’s like “Maybe. Possibly”
I’ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy
Too pussy to actually face me properly
He’s pissing himself worried that he’ll take a loss to me (colostomy)
It’s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy
Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude?
Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?!
And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate
It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday
We’re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know
Because they rap for, YOUR platform – this sports arena that you own
I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go
This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show
I’ve also seen your battles though – I’ve got you figured out: 'Roids
Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised
Think about it all he has is a loud voice
But your writing’s more of a shits how than Mrs. Brown’s Boys
You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes
You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis
I don’t care who’s most popular, I care about who’s the nicest
You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis
Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin
But now he’s addicted to working out and it’s poisoned him
You on social media is an extremely annoying thing
My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym
I want the stick person that we’ve seen, this version baffles me
Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we’ll see a big surge in casualties
Such a fake guy he’ll only fake fight, he’ll inverse to atrophy
Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality
I’m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed
I’m talking to him, since it’s clear a therapist never did
Cause you on social media is nuts
I mean, you’ve got this anger that brews
There’s different versions of him, these doppelgängers you use
Someone says something you don’t like? He’s gotten mad in a mood
Now, Shotty’s back in the room, you’re not the Adam we knew
This constant angst is problematic, what’s the matter? Drop the act
This rotten apple’s, gotten bad, he’s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you’re not a man you’re a youth
That’s not what adults should do
Acting like everyone’s against him, what an arrogant view
Like you’re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve
Not everybody’s a snake, a shocking fact, but it’s true
When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you
You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer
Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user
Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future
I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa
So don’t let his bullshit blur your vision
Don’t be intimidated by a word he’s written
Cause what he writes isn’t true like tabloid journalism
So don’t be scared, most Horroh’s (horror) stories are a work of fiction
He's alright, isn't he?
Probably someone with a case for the top 4
Not many can joke as good as him
You normally know I'm goin' to win
But today...you aren't sure
That's fine
Bastards
He's a formidable opponent
You're just livin' in the moment
That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors
Until Brizzy said, ""Look Shuffle over"", well then I made space for one more
The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene
For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh
Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed
I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed
Funny how you're called ""Shuffle"" when we always know what's comin' next
I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme & Rap Beginner classes
Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes
With a knife that's stashed within my jacket
Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed
Drive it back
The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction
You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta
They kinda clash as mirror matches
Cause you're both full of gas
And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with
Try me, try me, try me
Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion
They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard
Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances
I heard, ""Shuffle's outside""
Let's get this Muppet outlined
I don't give a fuck about rhymes
I got this gun from 'round mines
Me and my cousin, downsized
It's just us and a brown ride 
Foot in his house like, ""Give it up or your pal dies.""
And Marlo stood there like, like, ""I don't mean to trouble you now guys
But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00
I'm just worried about time
Gun butt him
Outlines
Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime
Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries
""Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!""
{gun cocks}
What does it sound like?
And Marlo stood there...joke
Fuck that! I'm outrageous
If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist
I'm the sensei
What's a sensation to an out station
Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations
There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers
If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient
Ahh
Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas
I am thee, without a doubt greatest
Out of town blazin', an ounce 
You're just me, without flavor
Downgraded, outdated
Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish
Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him
Fuck Shuffle T!
I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements
DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers
You rhyme words together really well
That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle
That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle
That's where you seem to struggle
You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle
YOU let him do this with no conviction
Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble
He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle
That's why we don't believe in ya
So many elite MC's that leagues above ya
We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle
You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part
I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card
You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code
Like it's an invincible spell
He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L
All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be
If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well
I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself
Second round in, safe star bless
Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left

{Shuffle pulls out his phone}
""Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR?
Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards
2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card
My place of work is Shotty Horroh’s Graveyard
My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start
I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar
And I think he’s in denial cause, I know where the graves are
And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast
If we ask too many questions he forces us out
He turns up some days and orders us 'round
He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now
Some are saying he won’t show up
That’s what people are saying
It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess
I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express
And if I ask how they died that’s a sackable offence
Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death?
I’m calling today cause I’ve just had someone through, Tali
Another hopeless victim
And I’m looking around and I’ve got no idea for the life of me where I’m s’posed to fit him
Plot 3?
No that’s taken. It’s taken it don’t need filling
Well, I can put Tali in there but he’s going to have Tony with him
I get that these things are best handled with stealth
It’s just - it’s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health
But I guess I’ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt
What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help.""
Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying
When he does smile, his Face ID doesn’t recognize him
That, and you've put on a  amount of weight
A bit of padding around the face
You're the man of the house, it's great
I bet your calorie count's insane
But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised
I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape
Now, he DID beat me in that film VS – but it was hard for me to lose that
Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, “We can’t really use that
It needs to be WORSE than Shotty’s material, so can you write us a new rap?”
I said, “WORSE than Shotty’s stuff…? I don’t know if I can do that.”
In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts
To make my stuff as bad as what’s coming out that fucking mouth of his
At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit
The director said, “I think we’ll need to dumb it down a bit.”
I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck
Producer called me personally said, “We need you for this, Shuff”
I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut
Apparently, me getting beat wasn’t “believable enough”
Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey
Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry
But it’s an understatement if you're describing me as ‘hungry’
That’s like calling Ian Huntley a ‘cheeky monkey’
I feel so comfy up here, I’m winning this in every round
I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown
You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh
We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half
Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you
The second that a battle’s not inside of the M62
I could’ve had this battle in your house in your parent’s living room
And have them both arguing over who they’d give it to
Your mom gives it to me
So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space
Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate’s rates
I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay
I don’t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today
Don’t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win’s clear on stage
I just don’t care about the teams, cause I’m not 6 years of age
Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million
I am my own worst critic and I think I’m fucking brilliant!
So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle
Let’s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word ‘shuffle’
Time

I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck
I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them
As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them
But there's this Joe Pesci notion...
Funny how? If you focusin'
Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em
Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin'
But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him
Cause I don't fuck my friends over
You get bad luck from it
Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic
Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever
He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure
He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better
Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together
He does not give a fuck
I've never met anybody as bold as he is
Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'?
And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings
He sat there like, ""What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating
Boys I have Ronan Keating.""
He does not give a fuck, you have to understand
That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys
Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists
I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down
I'm just sayin', you ain't legit
Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this
Loyal to the soil
I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz
You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit
That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this
Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it
And I'm the guy that pays you it
And I did your little panel show for free twice
It was COVID times I let the love persuade me
You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy
You came at me with the whole ""we're friends"" angle and I 
Cause me charging Shuffle shady
Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was ""fuck you pay me""
So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class
These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps
And wanna turn it into data and a 
""Click this link and learn how to be hip hop""
FUCK OFF!
We ain't got the patience for all a dat
For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed
I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book
I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps
People hated, FUCK THAT
I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank
Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match
Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut
Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious
It's not a joke
Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks
It's one of those
Why do your arms look so heavy bro?
I gotta know
You look like every single  trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home
Fuckin' strange guy
Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time
And thank you very much
Another straight, white, male with a podcast
With long hair and edgy jokes
It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand
That's me, thank you

Now your music has actually been a little different lately
When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady
That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy
I said, “Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?” He said “mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!""
I said, “Yeah, Definitely Maybe
Here’s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little'
Then you just 'Roll With It'
Head up in the clouds
I mean he doesn’t hear it
It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about
No one’s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound
In fact, I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
'Don't Look Back In Anger'
You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock
Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it’s not
You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully
But musically, now you’re nowhere near as good as it used to be
Cause when you sell out your art for a dime
It’ll never be far from your mind
Cause when you’ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb
You’re energy starved and you’ll try, but never regrasp on those heights
Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines
And everything’s harder to rhyme
Integrity’s hard to define
But when you pretend to be part of a life
Of the celebrity’s art that you like
All you’re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime
So, all you’ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise
That’s why you’re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes
Tonight Matthew, I’m going to shove Noel’s Gallagher’s dick in every hole that it can fit
The only role that you can give, this ain’t a cold slap on the wrist
You’re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6
That’s why he’s saying shit lines these days like
""It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets"", oh my God, you're such a prick
The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn’t fuck with it
I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn’t keep up with it
Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit
""Italian blood running the streets"" – I’ll slow down I’m out maneuvering
I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring
See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym
I don’t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him
Let me say something simple and make it official
Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle
Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme
You make it sound complex but it’s always just the same obnoxious theme
People used to be able to battle in a way they’d want to speak
Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean?
Every line it’s “I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?”
I’m just watching from the side like “Mate. It isn’t that clever.”
So, I won’t dress this up with word play I’ll just tell you what the truth is
I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit
Your battles aren’t that great these days, neither is your music
I think you’re overrated, and I think you’re fuckin' stupid
This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent
You make something simple feel like rocket science
I make rocket science feel like comic timing
Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python
It doesn’t make an ounce of difference how you spin it
Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted
I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness
This counterfeited coward’s limits
There’s always praise for you and you’re showered with it
Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit
They put you in the top 4 they’ve mapped out your image
Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I’ll take Mount Olympus
You say I’m a clown as if it means that I’m annoyed
I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy
So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy!
Take that belt to its biting point
I’ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you’ll have a higher voice than a choirboy’s!
If you’re watching from overseas – watch more UK battle rap
Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It’s action packed
Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq
Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat!
See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle’s what I make it
You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips
You’re an imitator – you see what’s out there and you claim it
I’m an innovator – I see what’s out there and I change it

With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (Woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (Woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (Woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (Woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (Okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (Boom)
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote

Home grown alligator, see you later
Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road
Something changed in the atmosphere
Architecture unfamiliar

Time flies by in the yellow and green
Stick around and you'll see what I mean
There's a mountain-top that I'm dreamin' of
If you need me you know where I'll be

I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun
Feelin' like a someone
I'll be ridin' shotgun underneath the hot sun

Gotta hit the road, gotta hit the road

Found you when your heart was broke

And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)

Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there

And calculated promises all in your conversation

Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well, that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time, I was findin' myself and I
Didn't know﻿ I was lost



I tried carryin' the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars""

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""

He said, ""Are you serious? I've tried, but I can't figure out
I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about
You keep ta- (Ta-ta-), talkin', but not much comin' out your mouth
Can't you tell that I want you?"", I say, yeah
I would want myself
Baby, please believe me

I see you eyein' me down, but you'll never know much past my name
Or how I'm runnin' this room around and that I'm still half your age
Yeah, you're loo- (Loo-loo-), lookin' at me like I'm some sweet escape
Obvious that you want me, but I said

We've been burnin' both ends
Keepin' the lights on
So I've been thinkin' we need
A little time alone

So what you say we cancel our plans?
Tonight I'm only gonna be your man

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make

There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh

We are, we are, we are

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('Round here)
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (Nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care

Now you're saying, slow it down, not right now
Then ya wink at me and walk away (Yeah)

You re-apply lippy 'cause it came off on the glass

Now ya beckoning for me to dance

You can't talk no shit without penalties
Bitch, I’m in yo’ shit if you send for me
I'm going to glow up one more time
Trust me, I have magical foresight
You gon’ see me sleepin' in courtside
You gon' see me eatin' ten more times

Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more
