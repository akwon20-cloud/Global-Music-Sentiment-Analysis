0,Ben&Ben - Kathang Isip,"29 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishKathang Isip Lyrics
'Di ba nga ito ang iyong gusto?
Oh, ito'y lilisan na ako
Mga alaala'y ibabaon
Kalakip ang tamis ng kahapon
Mga gabing 'di namamalayang oras ay lumilipad
Mga sandaling lumalayag kung sa'n man tayo mapadpad
Bawat kilig na nadarama sa tuwing hawak ang 'yong kamay
Ito'y maling akala, isang malaking sablay

Pasensya ka na
Sa mga kathang isip kong ito
Wari'y dala lang ng pagmamahal sa iyo
Ako'y gigising na
Sa panaginip kong ito
At sa wakas ay kusang lalayo sa iyo
(Lalayo sa)

Gaano kabilis nagsimula
Gano'n katulin nawala
Maaari ba tayong bumalik sa umpisa?
Upang 'di na umasa ang pusong nag-iisa?

Pasensya ka na (Pasensya ka na)
Sa mga kathang isip kong ito
Wari'y dala lang ng pagmamahal sa iyo
Ako'y gigising na (Ako'y gigising na)
Sa panaginip kong ito
At sa wakas ay kusang lalayo sa iyo

Nasusulyapan ang kahapon
At sa aking bawat paghinga
Ikaw ang nasa isip ko, sinta

1,Up Dharma Down - Tadhana,"17 ContributorsTadhana Lyrics
Sa hindi inaasahang
Pagtatagpo ng mga mundo
May minsan lang na nagdugtong
Damang-dama na ang ugong nito

'Di pa ba sapat ang sakit at lahat
Na hinding-hindi ko ipararanas sa'yo?
Ibinubunyag ka ng iyong matang
Sumisigaw ng pagsinta

Ba't 'di papatulan ang pagsuyong nagkulang?
Tayong umaasang hilaga't kanluran
Ikaw ang hantungan
At bilang kanlungan mo
Ako ang sasagip sa'yo

Saan nga ba patungo? (Saan nga ba patungo?)
Nakayapak at nahihiwagaan
Ang bagyo ng tadhana ay
Dinadala ako sa init ng bisig mo

Ba't 'di pa sabihin ang hindi mo maamin?
Ipauubaya na lang ba 'to sa hangin?
'Wag mong ikatakot ang bulong ng damdamin mo
Naririto ako't nakikinig sa'yo

2,James Arthur - Say You Won't Let Go,"150 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçePortuguêsDeutschالعربيةBahasa IndonesiaSay You Won’t Let Go Lyrics
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

I could say I never dare
To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that

In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto somethin'
Who could say that they saw us comin'?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams

I can think of all the times
You told me not to touch the light
I never thought that you would be the one
I couldn't really justify
How you even thought it could be right
'Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh, you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

Try as hard as I might
To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real

Magmamahal, oh, mahiwaga

Matang magkakilala
Sa unang pagtagpo
Paano dahan-dahang
Sinuyo ang puso?
Kay tagal ko nang nag-iisa
Andiyan ka lang pala

Mahiwaga
Pipiliin ka sa araw-araw
Mahiwaga
Ang nadarama sa'yo'y malinaw

Higit pa sa ligaya
Hatid sa damdamin
Lahat naunawaan

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I miss your touch some nights when I'm hollow
I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me
Your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life
I miss you more than life

Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
I need more time, but time can't be borrowed
I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
Since the love that you left is all that I get, I want you to know

That if I can't be close to you
I'll settle for the ghost of you

Wonder what I'll do when the cops come through
And the whiskey's run out
'Cause I've been lookin' at you since half past two
Wanna take this downtown?
This liquid courage got me way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate, let's catch a vibe, babe
While the sun's down
Hush now, I know we're a little too fucked up to stay still, love
Be as quiet as you can, 'cause if anyone sees
They'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know if you're taken
I'll just let ya know bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know, just us and the moon 'til the sun starts wakin'

Up's the only direction I see
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low-key (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo- lo-love me (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand, boy

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Masasabayan ang 'yong yapak
Sa pagngiti at pag-iyak
Sa paglipad at pagbagsak ng araw-araw
Sa pagpikit na lang kita
Matititigan sa mata
Sa panaginip na magpapaligaw

Kamusta ka na? Kahit 'wag nang sagutin
'Di ba nawala ang kintab ng bituin?
Sana gano'n ka nga pa rin

'Cause, it's been raining in Manila, hindi ka ba nilalamig?

I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better than the summer
Of 2002 (Ooh)

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)

Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' ""bye, bye, bye""
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singin' at the top of both our lungs

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had, she's showing off
Driving too fast, moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

(Ooh) We're only getting older, baby
(Ooh) And I've been thinking about it lately
(Ooh) Does it ever drive you crazy
(Ah-ah-ah) Just how fast the night changes?
(Ooh) Everything that you've ever dreamed of
(Ooh) Disappearing when you wake up
(Ooh) But there's nothing to be afraid of
(Ah-ah-ah) Even when the night changes
(Ooh) It will never change me and you

Chasing her tonight, doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Moving too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
