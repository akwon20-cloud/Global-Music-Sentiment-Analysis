0,James Arthur - Say You Won't Let Go,"150 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάTürkçePortuguêsDeutschالعربيةBahasa IndonesiaSay You Won’t Let Go Lyrics
I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
We danced the night away, we drank too much
I held your hair back when you were throwin' up

Then, you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, ""I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest""

I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you, but I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, woah
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day, you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

I'm so in love with you and I hope you know
Darlin', your love is more than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old

Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me when I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out
I promise till death we part, like in our vows
So, I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows
That it's just you and me till we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go153Embed"

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Lovin' can hurt
Lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
And when it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

Lovin' can heal
Lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya

But I hope I never see them again

And I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer

Of 2002 (Ooh)

We were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, ""Love is forever and ever""
Well, I guess that was true (Ooh)

Dancin' on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say

Oops, I got 99 problems, singin' ""bye, bye, bye""
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh

I need more time, but time can't be borrowed

我聽見雨滴落在青青草地
我聽見遠方下課鐘聲響起
可是我沒有聽見你的聲音
認真 呼喚我姓名
愛上你的時候還不懂感情
離別了才覺得刻骨銘心
為什麼沒有發現遇見了你?
是生命最好的事情

也許當時忙著微笑和哭泣
忙著追逐天空中的流星
人理所當然的忘記
是誰風裏雨裏一直默默守護在原地

原來你是我最想留住的幸運
原來我們和愛情曾經靠得那麼近
那為我對抗世界的決定
那陪我淋的雨
一幕幕都是你
一塵不染的真心
與你相遇好幸運
可我已失去為你淚流滿面的權利
但願在我看不到的天際
你張開了雙翼
遇見你的註定
她會有多幸運

And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you

'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

When you hurt under the surface

Well, time can heal, but this won't

So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If only I'da known you had a storm to weather
So before you go
Was there something I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So before you go

Was never the right time whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all

But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking

Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know

If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before

Should've known your love was a game

I look up from the ground
To see your sad and teary eyes
You look away from me
And I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold
You pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's
They were my mate's
And I feel the colour draining from my face

And my friend said
""I know you love her, but it's over, mate
It doesn't matter, put the phone away
It's never easy to walk away, let her go
It'll be alright""

So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent
And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just wanna stay

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

I won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off, but I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time in this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop

I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can

I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do

'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'
When you should be with me instead?
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can

Take my hand, we'll be fine

Promise I'll never let you down

And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me, why are we wasting time
On all your wasted cryin'

To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that

In the midst of the crowds
In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto somethin'
Who could say that they saw us comin'?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams

You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away and out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me if I decide that you're my destiny?

What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine?
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you and it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours tonight

You think it's easy?
You think I don't want to run to you?
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you're wonderin' why
Because we're able to be just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're gonna wake up and see that it was hopeless after all

How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours tonight

All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you

And the crowds don't remember my name

54,张远 - 嘉宾,"1 Contributor嘉宾 (Guest) Lyrics
分手后第几个冬季
今天是星期几
偶尔会想起你
你突如其来的简讯
让我措手不及
愣住站在原地

当所有人都替你开心
我却才傻傻清醒
原来早已有人为你订做了嫁衣

感谢你特别邀请
来见证你的爱情
我时刻提醒自己 别逃避
拿着喜帖一步一步走近
他精心布置的场地
可惜这是属于你的风景
而我只是嘉宾
我放下所有回忆
来成全你的爱情
却始终不愿相信 这是命
好久不见的你有点疏离
握手寒暄如此客气
何必要在他的面前刻意
隐瞒我的世界 有过你

不知不觉钟声响起
你守候在原地
等待着他靠近
温柔的他单膝跪地
钻戒缓缓戴进
你的无名指里

当所有人都替你开心
我却才傻傻清醒
原来我们之间已没有任何关系

感谢你特别邀请
来见证你的爱情
我时刻提醒自己 别逃避
今天你妆扮得格外美丽
这美也曾拥在怀里
可惜这是你和他的婚礼
而我只是嘉宾
我放下所有回忆
来成全你的爱情
却始终不愿相信 这是命
说好的永远变成了曾经
我试着衷心祝福你
请原谅我不体面没出息
选择失陪一下 先离席
又不是偶像剧
怎么我演得那么入戏
这不堪入目的剧情

感谢你特别邀请
观赏你要的爱情
嘉宾也许是另一种宿命
离开你的自己事到如今
还有什么资格关心
毕竟终成眷属的人是你
而我只是嘉宾
我流尽所有回忆
来庆祝你的婚礼
却始终没有勇气 祝福你
谢谢你送给我最后清醒
把自己还给我自己
至少我还能够成为那个
见证你们爱情的嘉宾
遇见你的他真的好幸运
但愿他会比我更爱你Embed"

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listenin' to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all

Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night

Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers

你住的巷子裡, 我租了一間公寓
爲了想與你不期而遇
高中三年, 我爲什麽, 爲什麽不好好讀書
沒考上跟你一樣的大學
我找了份工作, 離你宿舍很近
當我開始學會做蛋餅, 才發現你不吃早餐
Oh, 你又擦肩而過
你耳機聼什麽, 能不能告訴我

躺在你學校的操場看星空
教室裡的燈, 還亮著你沒走
記得我寫給你的情書
都什麽年代了, 到現在我還在寫著
總有一天, 總有一年, 會發現
有人默默的陪在你的身邊
也許我不該在你的世界
當你收到情書, 也代表我已經走遠

學校旁的廣場, 我在這等鐘聲響
等你下課一起走好嗎
彈著琴, 唱你愛的歌, 暗戀一點都不痛苦
痛苦的是你根本沒看我
我唱這麽走心, 卻走不進你心裡
在人來人往找尋著你, 守護著你不求結局
Oh, 你又擦肩而過
我唱""告白氣球"", 終於你回了頭

遠距離的欣賞 近距離的迷惘
誰說太陽會找到月亮
別人有的愛 我們不可能模仿
修煉愛情的悲歡 我們這些努力不簡單
快樂煉成淚水 是一種勇敢

為一張臉去養一身傷
別講想念我 我會受不了這樣
記憶它真囂張 路燈把痛點亮
情人一起看過多少次月亮
他在天空看過多少次遺忘

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Won't give my heart up for breaking

Dancing on the edge, 'bout to take it too far
It's messing with my head, how I mess with your heart
If you wake up in your bed, alone in the dark
I'm sorry, gotta leave before you love me

Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me
Ayy, ayy, leave before you love me

Messing with my head, how I mess with your heart

Take a seat
Right over there, sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go

Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle

Oh, take a step, uh
Back for a minute, into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still runnin', dishes are broken
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
I know we meant all good intentions

Regardless of my objection, yeah
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin
Just come over, pull me in, just

Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, ""Thank you"" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Thank you, next (Next)

One

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone

I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart (I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it 'cause I (I got new, I got new)

One, don't pick up the phone (Yeah)
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone (Alone)
Two, don't let him in (Oh-ooh)
You'll have to kick him out again (Again)

And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
